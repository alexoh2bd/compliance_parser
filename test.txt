Core / 
Foundational
Just as the name implies, standards included in this section are “core” to a camp accredited by 
the American Camp Association. Users expect clean and repaired facilities and to be treated 
with respect and dignity.  For day, resident, and short-term camps, clearly articulated goals, 
outcomes, and activities designed to assist in camper development are core to guiding the 
camp’s focus and programming.

CR.1 - RIGHTS AND DIGNITY OF CAMPERS/STAFF
Applies to:
•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
•Short-term 
camps
•Camps serving 
rental groups
CR.1.1 - Does the camp have a philosophy or statement specific to respecting the rights 
and dignity of all individuals that:
A. Is shared with all staff;
B. Staff are trained to facilitate; and
C. Is shared with parents/guardians and campers?
Contextual Education
ACA and the camp community strives to be more inclusive and serve a more diverse 
population. The intent of this standard is for the camp’s leadership to create a statement for the 
camp related to respecting the rights and dignities of all individuals. It should be shared with all 
campers, staff, and parents/guardians.  Such a statement could mention expectations for 
respectful communications with and regarding all individuals, and might go on to specifically 
indicate individuals of varying abilities, cultures, genders, races, religions, and so on. The 
statement might speak to what the camp teaches, how campers and staff are expected to 
interact, the example staff sets for campers, and the examples that all camp participants set as 
they return to their own worlds. Training for staff may include both precamp and in-service 
sessions to help staff recognize and value individual differences within groups, particularly in 
relation to the camper populations served.

CR.2.1 - To help provide a quality camp experience, has the camp:
Established a written statement of overall goals and outcomes for participants?
CR.2.2 - To help provide a quality camp experience, has the camp:
Identified in writing specific measurable outcomes that address the campers’ physical, 
social, and mental well-being?
CR.2.3 - To help provide a quality camp experience, has the camp:
Provided staff with training strategies that help campers achieve established outcomes 
in the camp program?
CR.2.4 - To help provide a quality camp experience, has the camp:
Informed parents and campers, as developmentally appropriate, of the intended 
outcomes of the camp experience?
Contextual Education
Goals express the purpose of the camp’s existence and operation.  For some camps, this may 
be articulated in the mission statement.  From these broad goals, the camp can determine 
specific outcomes that are desired as a result of participating in camp activities and 
experiences.  If goals of a national organization are used, they must relate to desired outcomes 
for the specific camp and clientele.  Outcomes for short-term programs may be different than 
those for a day camp or extended-stay resident camp.  For purposes of this standard, an 
outcome is a skill, attitude, knowledge, or ability that a young person gains when they attend 
camp. 
Parents and campers should be informed about the camp’s goals, and given some ideas as to 
the nature of the outcomes that might be observed so they are able to evaluate the effect of the 
camp experience.

CR.3 - CAMPER DEVELOPMENT
Applies to:
•Day camps
•Resident

CR.3.1 - Does the camp program provide specific activities that are designed to help 
campers develop mental, emotional, social, and physical health?
Contextual Education
The camp community provides an exceptional opportunity for campers to develop and 
experience mental, emotional, social, and physical health. To be effective, the camp must 
identify these areas as goals and foster specific activities or experiences to provide the greatest 
opportunity for age-appropriate mental, emotional, social, and physical health development to 
occur. Staff should be trained to lead the activities and be aware of the observable outcomes 
that indicate such development.

CR.4 - ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES
Applies to:
•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
CR.4.1 - Does the camp provide for each age group served, in day and resident camp 
programs, structured activities that help:
A. Develop awareness for the natural environment;
B. Build appreciation and responsibility for the natural environment; and
C. Foster a stewardship philosophy including practices to minimize the camp’s impact 
on the environment?
Contextual Education
The staff should be mindful of ways to help campers develop an awareness of the natural 
environment.  This environmental education may be different for camps that take place in the 
outdoors vs. camps that occur indoors. Each age group should have opportunities to learn 
about the natural world through hands-on experiences that may involve art, music, games, 
nature activities, etc. Campers and staff should practice responsible behaviors such as 
recycling, water conservation, and minimizing environmental impacts, including proper trail use 
(even in urban settings). Knowledge and use of the Leave No Trace principles is strongly 
recommended.

Administration
: Site and 
Transportation
ADMINISTRATION Administrative standards include policies and procedures for which key 
administrative staff are most typically responsible for writing and distributing. Topics include 
transportation, risk management, emergency procedures, policies related to camp staff, and 
various program areas.  For some key topics, the writing and maintaining of the policy/procedure 
is addressed in this section of standards, and the training and implementation of the procedure is 
in the staff training standards. 
ADMINISTRATION: Site and Transportation
The camp’s transportation practices promote safety, minimize risk, and help administrators 
consider the critical aspect of traffic control, vehicular safety, driver qualifications and camper 
education.
All camps must score AD.1 through AD.4.  
Transportation standards AD.5 through AD.10 apply to any and all transportation of campers, 
staff, or rental group members provided by, planned for, or arranged by the camp, whether in 
owned, leased, private, or commercial land vehicles.  This includes as examples: 
•Camp-arranged transportation to and from camp
•Transportation to activity sites such as pools, stables, lakes, or vendor-provided programs
•Transportation for day trips or field trips 
•Transportation for non-emergency doctor visits (even the occasional visit) 
•Transportation to trip sites and within the trip/travel program itself 
•Group transportation in any kind of passenger vehicle, including bus, van, SUV, and car
These standards do not apply to use of regularly scheduled public transportation (e.g., trains, 
limos, buses, taxis, Uber) or to watercraft transportation, such as ferries, whose operations are 
subject to local or other regulations.  They do not apply to rental groups that provide their own 
transportation. 
These standards are not scored for camp maintenance vehicles (e.g., tractors, trucks, golf carts) 
unless they are used to transport persons other than maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, 
health supervisors, or administrative staff.  However, camps are advised to consider the 
requirements of transportation standards when establishing guidelines for any vehicle used 
within the camp operation. 
This section applicability also includes the additional transportation standards, FA.22 through 
FA.24, ST.18, ST.19, and ST.39.

AD.1.1 - Does the camp make annual contact with all applicable local emergency officials 
to notify them of the camp’s dates of operation and relevant scope of programming 
(including items such as clients served, significant elements of the program, and 
overview of the facilities)?
Contextual Education
The purpose of this communication is to verify emergency officials have the correct and 
appropriate emergency contact and response information for the camp.  Contact should be 
made even if the camp has access to the 911 system.  This may include fire, law enforcement, 
emergency medical services, civil defense, homeland security, forest service, national park 
service, or other local officials — depending on the location and risk management issues of the 
camp and its program sites. Even in locations where the camp is automatically covered by 
municipal emergency services, the camp should notify officials of the number, the age of 
campers and scope of the camp operation to assure that the camp’s crisis response plan is 
consistent with local emergency procedures.

AD.2.1 - If the camp does not use 911 for emergency medical transportation, does the 
camp have a policy that requires emergency transportation be available at all times by 
the camp being accredited or by the rental group?
Contextual Education
“Available” by the camp means that specifically designated vehicle(s) are in operational order 
with enough fuel to reach primary emergency locations and are not being used for other jobs.
If rental groups are responsible for their own emergency transportation, this expectation should 
be identified in a contract or use agreement, or clearly specified in written procedures provided 
to groups.  For additional safety, emergency numbers and directions to the camp should be 
posted or provided.

use their vehicle(s) for transportation for camp business?
Contextual Education
The purpose of this standard is to confirm that the owner specifically grants permission for the 
vehicle to be used for camp business.  Permission is assumed (i.e., written authorization not 
required) if the owner is driving his or her own vehicle.  Owners who grant permission are not 
required to show maintenance records on private vehicles.  However, camps may want to 
advise vehicle owners that their permission implies their responsibility to have an adequately 
maintained and insured vehicle.

procedures for the unloading and loading of vehicles, and guidelines for supervision of 
the area and people in it during this time?
Contextual Education
The intent of this standard is to provide an orderly system for the arrival and departure of groups 
and/or individuals by bus or van and of individuals by personal vehicles. In this situation, some 
procedures may be as simple as designating parking areas and prohibiting traffic in most areas 
of the camp site.  Camps that allow motorized traffic beyond the welcome area may need more 
elaborate plans.

Contextual Education
The intent of standard AD.7.1 is not to mandate restraint devices in vehicles such as school 
buses where seat belts are not required by law, although all applicable state regulations 
regarding restraint devices and child booster seats must be followed.  Procedures should also 
specify when passengers under a certain size should be restricted to rear seats in vehicles 
when air bag safety is a concern.  The requirement to remain seated may be modified, as 
appropriate, when campers are traveling in motor coaches with toilets on board.  When 
passengers in wheelchairs are transferred to vehicle seats, they should wear the provided seat 
belts.

AD.13.1 - For risk management planning, has the camp:
Identified and analyzed potential risks related to human, financial/operational, and 
property liabilities?
AD.13.2 - For risk management planning, has the camp:
Identified risk control techniques currently being implemented to reduce, control, or 
prevent potential loss in identified exposure areas?
Contextual Education 
While the requirements of the accreditation standards address many of the commonly identified 
risk management concerns in camp operations, a camp needs to evaluate its overall operations 
to identify areas that may be site-specific or not addressed by individual standards. Camp 
administrators need to evaluate risk exposure in three major areas: 
1. Human Liabilities 
•Standard of care liabilities (tort or third-party liabilities)—injury to persons caused by 
negligence, such as injuries related to health services, maintenance, vehicle operation, 
attractive nuisances, staff selection, staff and camper supervision, inappropriate actions 
by staff or campers, and other hazards related to the conduct of people; 
•Loss of human resources (participants, staff, and/or volunteers)— ramification of loss of 
a human resource on the operation, such as loss of public credibility; loss of income; loss 
of campers or staff due to stress, injury, illness, death, or other impairment; 
2. Financial/Operational Liabilities 
•Contract liabilities—includes, as examples, lease or rental contracts, contracts for 
service, program activity contracts, employment agreements, insurance, and other 
policies that may bind the camp; and 
3. Property Resources 
•Property, buildings, and equipment loss—loss due to fire, collapse, or other damage from 
natural disasters; breakdown of machinery or equipment; and other hazards related to 
facilities, property development, or the operation of equipment on the site and so forth. 
Risk management materials should analyze risk exposure in all areas and specify techniques 
currently being implemented to reduce, control, or prevent identified risks. 
In AD.13.2, “risk control techniques” include identifying what methods are being used to control 
risks and what specific techniques or steps are being taken as part of that method. 
Camps may follow the outline and process provided in the Risk Exposure Chart on the ACA 
website, or may want to develop their own risk exposure chart or outline. In either case, the 
chart should identify the risk areas outlined above that require consideration by camp operators.

AD.14 - INCIDENT REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
Applies to: 
•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
•Short-term 
camps
•Camps serving 
rental groups
Written 
Documentation 
Required
AD.14.1 - Are staff required to complete written reports describing incidents, accidents, 
“near misses,” and emergencies that may not result in injuries?
AD.14.2 - With assistance from outside advisors, does the camp:,
A. Annually review and analyze when and where incidents, accidents, and injuries 
occurred;
B. Identify steps to reduce incidents, accidents, and injuries; and
C. Modify procedures and implement changes as necessary?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is twofold. First, to document circumstances, witnesses, and actions 
in serious situations that result in, or nearly result in, injury or danger to individuals. The camp 
director has the responsibility to determine the level of severity or seriousness of incidents that 
must be reported. 
Examples of “incidents” and “accidents” include fires; natural disasters; danger from intruders or 
trespassers; crises arising out of camper, staff, or rental group behavior (e.g., fighting, serious 
emotional outbursts, threatening others); or other situations posing serious safety threats. 
Examples of “near misses” and “emergencies not resulting in injury” may include lost campers, 
near drownings, or the use of drugs or alcohol by staff or participants. 
The second intent of this standard is to verify that the camp has a system in place to regularly 
review all facets of the camp program and property to revise or develop appropriate policies, 
protocols, and risk management materials, as identified. The camp may use a safety committee, 
camp services committee, or other group with a representative mix of expertise in the camp’s 
programs and clientele to analyze the operation or the camp may consult with other outside 
advisors such as consultants, parents, healthcare personnel, insurance personnel, or other 
camp administrators. Review/analysis of annual fire and electrical safety exams (standards FA.5 
and FA.6), ropes course inspections (standard PD.14), and health procedures review (standard 
HW.9) may be part of this process. 
Camps exclusively serving rental groups may collect data from evaluation forms but may also 
require that accident/incident reports be completed as applicable.

AD.15.1 - Does the camp have the following insurance coverage in place:
Commercial general liability coverage?
AD.15.2 - Does the camp have the following insurance coverage in place:
Workers’ compensation for all eligible and required staff?
AD.15.3 - Does the camp have the following insurance coverage in place:
At minimum, basic causes of loss on buildings coverage?
AD.15.4 - Does the camp have the following insurance coverage in place:
Business personal property coverage (contents)?
AD.15.5 - Does the camp have the following insurance coverage in place:
Motor vehicle insurance (as applicable):
A. Coverage on all owned, hired, or leased vehicles; and/or
B. Employer’s non-ownership liability insurance on all non-owned vehicles?
AD.15.6 - Does the camp have the following insurance coverage in place:
Coverage for campers (carried by the camp or written evidence that each camper has 
such coverage):
A. For resident campers—medical and accident coverage; and/or 
B. For day campers and short-term campers—accident coverage?
Contextual Education 
Camps should check on exclusions in liability coverage to be sure all camp programs (e.g., 
tripping, horseback riding, aquatics, ropes course) are covered. When third-party providers of 
activities or services are used, camps are advised to confirm insurance coverage and 
requirements and request a Certificate of Insurance naming the camp as additionally insured. 
Workers’ compensation is generally required for all employees, including international staff. 
Camps are advised to check state laws for the applicability of workers’ compensation for all staff 
and volunteers. 
Business personal property insurance provides coverage for furniture, fixtures, merchandise, 
and all personal property owned by the camp and used for business, even if the camp does not

own the building. 
Camps are advised to evaluate motor vehicle insurance coverage needed both for vehicles 
leased for the entire season as well as those hired for a day trip. Vehicles leased for the season 
need coverage for liability as well as physical damage. Camps should also consider implications 
of use of staff cars for camp business and determine insurance coverage accordingly. 
Camper coverage may be provided by the camp, parents, agency, school, or individual. When 
the camp does not provide the coverage, written evidence of coverage must be provided (i.e., 
parent’s signature along with the policy number).

Contextual Education 
All firearms must be locked when not in use and stored in locations separate from ammunition. 
Trigger locks are acceptable when used correctly. 
This standard is not intended to be applied to homes or buildings that are on camp property and 
used solely as private residences of staff, are designed for the exclusive use of the individual

AD.18.1 - Does the camp conduct an annual review of the security concerns of the site 
and establish a written plan for how to address concerns such as possible intruders and 
active threats? Training and rehearsal of this plan is scored in standard ST.22.
Contextual Education 
Camps are strongly urged to work directly with their local authorities as they develop their plan 
for this standard as well as their “emergency plan” required in AD.18.1. Resources are available 
on the ACA website, ACAcamps.org, using the search words “camp security.” “Active threat” is 
defined as: as any incident, which by its deliberate nature creates an immediate threat or 
presents an imminent danger to the camp community. This includes active shooter situations. 
In addition to addressing the intrusion of unauthorized persons, a camp should also consider 
how to address both invited and “surprise” guests. 
If the camp is operating on a public or non-owned site, “site” refers to the living and/or program 
areas used by the camp group(s). Working with the rental site’s administration to develop the 
plan is recommended.

AD.19.1 - Does the camp require that campers, staff, and rental groups be oriented to 
established written safety regulations and emergency procedures for the general camp 
area that include:
A. Identification of boundaries for living areas and general activity areas;
B. Expectations for appropriate behavior;
C. Precautions concerning natural or physical hazards of the site; and
D. For natural disasters and other reasonably foreseeable emergencies, what to do in 
case of emergency including building and site evacuation procedures?
Training and rehearsal of this plan is scored in standard ST.23.
Contextual Education 
Boundaries, behaviors, precautions, and emergency procedures can be described verbally in an 
orientation, marked with posted signs, and/or provided in information given to group leaders. 
These points may be included in a written list, which may be bullet points on a memo, signs 
posted on the wall, or a literal checklist. The intent is to assure that all points are covered with 
all campers, staff, and rental groups. 
The phrase “Natural disasters and other reasonably foreseeable emergencies” includes natural 
disasters that are typical of the area (e.g., storms, earthquakes, wildfires, floods) as well as 
emergencies such as power outages and other local threats. Emergency procedures should be 
specific to the site, staffing, type of camp operation, and clientele. The complexity of procedures 
will vary based on camp location, type of operation, staff responsibility for supervision of 
individuals, and availability and responsibility of staff when rental groups are present. Camps 
are advised to include local officials in the development of emergency plans and/or share their 
emergency plans with local officials.

Contextual Education 
AD.23.1 includes procedures for releasing campers to authorized persons during camp (e.g., a 
visit) or at the end of the camp day/session. These procedures may include the policy that the 
camp will follow if a minor is not picked up within a reasonable time (e.g., supervision and extra 
charges). 
For AD.23.2, “absentee campers” are participants who are not present when the camp expects 
to assume responsibility for those individuals. The procedures should specify the time that the 
check is done. The policies should specify to whom the practices apply, for example, to 
campers transported by the camp but not to those who are delivered to camp by the 
parents/guardians.

n: Human 
Resources
ADMINISTRATION 
Administrative standards include policies and procedures for which key administrative staff are 
most typically responsible for writing and distributing. Topics include transportation, risk 
management, emergency procedures, policies related to camp staff, and various program areas. 
For some key topics, the writing and maintaining of the policy/procedure is addressed in this 
section of standards, and the training and implementation of the procedure is in the staff training 
standards.
ADMINISTRATION: Human Resources 
The physical, emotional, and mental well-being of campers is the most important part of a 
camp’s work. This can be more readily accomplished when a camp has a thorough screening 
and hiring process. 
Personnel to be considered in the screening process include: 
•Volunteer and paid staff involved with the operation of both the site and programming 
•Volunteer and paid staff who are supervised by the camp operator/ director, and 
•Volunteer and paid staff for which the operator/director has overall responsibility for 
selection, training, supervision, and dismissal. 
While these standards do not generally apply to consultants, workshop leaders, or vendors, 
administrators should consider the requirements of screening in utilizing such persons.

Identify appropriate application and screening processes for each job category?
AD.24.2 - Does the camp have written hiring policies that:
Have been reviewed by legal counsel or a human resources professional within the last 
three (3) years?
Contextual Education 
Developing hiring policies should include a review of the staff application form(s), job 
descriptions, interviewing requirements, and initial screening techniques to determine the 
appropriate content and steps for each type of position. The camp must determine, with the 
advice of a professional, which items are appropriate for each type of staff position and which 
may be required by law. For example, the screening process for a kitchen or grounds worker 
may be different than that for a cabin counselor or program specialist. AD.24.2 specifically alerts 
camps of the need to develop policies and practices with the aid of sound legal and professional 
advice. 
State and local entities have different requirements that may govern practices. This policy 
should be set in conjunction with recommendations from the insurance company and legal 
counsel.

AD.25.1 - Does the camp require screening for all new camp staff based on camp 
property (directors, counselors, administrative, and support staff; seasonal and year-
round staff members; and paid, volunteer, and contracted personnel) that includes:
A criminal background check for staff eighteen years of age and older?
AD.25.2 - Does the camp require screening for all new camp staff based on camp 
property (directors, counselors, administrative, and support staff; seasonal and year-
round staff members; and paid, volunteer, and contracted personnel) that includes:
At least two reference checks and verification of previous work (including volunteer) 
history?
AD.25.3 - Does the camp require screening for all new camp staff based on camp 
property (directors, counselors, administrative, and support staff; seasonal and year-
round staff members; and paid, volunteer, and contracted personnel) that includes:
A personal interview by the camp director or a designated representative?
Contextual Education 
Staff are considered “new” upon initial hiring and if there is a break in employment of twelve (12) 
months or more. Year-round staff, including directors, must be screened upon entry and 
thereafter according to the policy of the camp (See AD.24). 
A criminal background check seeks information regarding additional criminal behavior, reported 
according to “levels” indicating the nature of the crime and the risk of repeat offense. The camp 
must have a specific plan for securing criminal background checks based on state laws, 
availability of data, cost, and type of staff. In many cases, a criminal record for minors may be 
available if a crime was committed in which the individual was charged as an adult. If a staff 
member is not eighteen (18) years of age at the start of employment, a criminal background 
check should be completed within three (3) months of the individual turning eighteen (18) if they 
are still employed by the camp at that time. Camps that hire international staff should take into 
account the screening practices of international placement agencies—in many cases, criminal 
background checks are provided through those agencies. 
“Verification” of work history means evaluation of the timeframes of previous jobs to determine 
reasons for any gaps in employment and spot checking to verify that the applicant was 
employed or licensed as claimed.
“Personal interviews” should occur face-to-face or by phone for all applicants, including 
international staff members. Even when initial interviews are conducted by a staff placement 
agency, camps should make their own contact with applicants before hiring to confirm language 
and communication skills, identify expectations for the job, determine the suitability for the 
specific job offered, and provide specific information about the camp program and location.

who come to the camp as a part of their responsibility. “Contracted” staff working in a typical 
staff role having contact with campers, such as food service, housekeeping, or maintenance

AD.28.1 - Prior to accepting a position, is each camp staff member provided with:
A. A written job description that identifies the responsibilities and essential functions of 
the job, and
B. Information on the nature and diversity of the total camp population, along with 
general characteristics of the camp and programs offered?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is to help make staff aware, prior to accepting a position, of some of 
the responsibilities and job tasks they will assume. 
Regarding Part A of the standard, job descriptions may be stand-alone documents provided at 
the interview or time of hire or may be form letters to the individuals where jobs are described. 
To be consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, job descriptions should identify the 
essential functions or tasks required for the job. “Essential functions” are those tasks and 
responsibilities the individual who holds the job would be expected to perform, with or without 
reasonable accommodation to be considered as qualified for the position. These functions must 
be job related and consistent with business necessity. 
Examples of essential function might include:

Documentation 
Required
AD.31.1 - Does the camp have an evaluation system in place that includes at least three 
(3) sources of feedback, documents whether stated goals/outcomes are met, and is 
applied to improve the quality of the camp experience?
Contextual Education 
The system of evaluation should use several methodologies to seek feedback from campers, 
parents, staff, and other stakeholders on both their satisfaction with the camp experience and 
evidence of achievement of the goals through measurable outcomes. According to ACA’s Camp 
Program Quality Assessment tool, a quality program is one that consistently promotes beneficial 
outcomes among youth through structured activities, unstructured time, interactions with staff, 
and administration and policies. There are many ways a camp can measure the achievement of 
outcomes, including the following as examples (all documented in some manner, such as in 
notes, audio recordings, videos, photos): 
•observing and recording behavioral changes; 
•focused dialogue at staff meetings; 
•camper and/or parent written or online surveys (related to all aspects of camp—program, 
administration, facilities, food service, staff, etc.); 
•structured conversations with campers/parents/staff; 
•documentation of involvement of campers in program planning; 
•focus groups; telephone interviews; and online feedback tools. 
It is important for the camp to receive feedback on its operational management (e.g., quality of 
food, cleanliness of the facilities, and efficiency of registration process) considering their impacts 
on program quality and the achievement of behavioral outcomes for the camper.

AD.32.1 - Has the camp identified, in writing, any eligibility requirements necessary for a 
camper to participate in each program activity and/or trip offered by the camp?
Contextual Education 
A camp/program should determine the appropriate and safe age/size and mental, emotional 
and/or social health status necessary for camper participation in all programs offered. Eligibility 
might depend on the length of the program, availability of appropriately sized safety equipment, 
and the overall progression opportunities offered. If some programs are provided by an outside 
provider/ vendor, their eligibility requirements must be considered. 
When trips of any length are offered, it is important to establish eligibility requirements for each 
type of trip and location. It is also important to consider the age, experience, physical, cognitive, 
and emotional health of all participants as well as length of trip, location, and skill level/s 
required. 
“Types of trips” include backcountry trips, tours to public attractions, contracted trips on rivers or 
oceans or in state or national parks, and urban trips and tours. Requirements and risks will vary 
and should be specified for each trip.

AD.33.1 - Does the camp:
Inform campers and their parents/guardians, in writing, of the specific nature of activities 
campers will be engaged in, the risks related to the activities (when applicable), and the 
degree of difficulty or physical challenge required by the activity (when applicable)?
AD.33.2 - Does the camp:
Require a signed statement from a parent/guardian that indicates approval for or denial 
of participation in camp activities by minor campers?
Contextual Education 
Consent for minor campers to participate in camp activities should be based on an informed 
understanding of those activities. Camps may publish information about typical activities in a 
brochure or in a precamp packet, or include a list of the commonly offered activities on the 
statement to be signed. Activities that are not generally familiar to parents, such as rock 
climbing or rafting or higher-risk activities, should be noted in written information about the camp 
before permission to participate is requested. For short-term programs, activities may be listed 
or described on a flyer or communicated in a meeting with parents prior to the camp session. 
When program activities occur away from the camp site, camps may wish to notify parents 
about the type and frequency of communication with the camp. If activities offered are under the 
supervision of someone else (such as horseback riding at the town stables where the stable 
staff are in charge, or use of another camp’s ropes course), such a change in supervision 
should be noted.

office? Information shall include: 
A. Roster of participants; 
B. Departure and return times; 
C. Inclement weather plans; 
D. Intended route(s); and 
E. Plans for communication with the designated person?
Contextual Education 
In Part A, “roster of participants” may be a complete list or a previously identified group (e.g., 
patrol, cabin, unit), with any exceptions noted. In Part E, “plans for communications” should 
identify times and means of contact that are planned in advance and made known to all parties. 
Camp officials and sometimes local authorities may need to contact a group regarding weather 
warnings or other emergency information. Emergency services personnel may require 
information on planned routes if a group does not report in regularly. In addition, itinerary details 
may be necessary should parents need to contact a participant in an emergency. If international 
travel occurs, it is important to consider the various components of this standard from that 
perspective.

Contextual Education 
The requirements of this standard are in addition to those in the Transportation section. Groups 
should have a minimum of one relief driver for every two vehicles. 
For transportation occurring for international travel, it is important for the camp to verify types of 
available communication, flexibility to adjust emergency procedures as necessary, and verify 
the reliability of any providers.

E. Any insurance coverage to be provided by the group; and 
F. Recommendations to rental group leaders of the need for appropriate screening 
policies for all rental-group staff with responsibility for or access to campers?
Contextual Education 
Regarding Part B, supervision of the group and its behavior includes defining who has the 
authority to remove individuals from the property. 
In Part C, “specialized recreation activities” are any activities whose safe conduct requires 
supervision by persons with specialized training and skills (e.g., swimming, archery, ropes 
course use). Supervision for general recreation activities, along with all other general activities 
not specified in the contract, would normally fall under Part B of this standard (supervision of the 
group and its behavior). 
Regarding Part D, orientation for rental groups should include general safety regulations, 
communication in an emergency (e.g., weather, missing persons), security concerns, and 
warning systems. Groups should know how to get emergency assistance and how to contact 
the site owner. 
Topics covered in this standard might also be covered in a camp’s Rental Group Manual. If this 
is done, a statement in the agreement must reference acceptance of responsibilities 
/requirements as described in the Rental Group Manual.

AD.39.1 - Does the camp advise rental group leaders in writing of procedures for use of 
kitchen facilities that include: 
A. Using only clean and sanitized utensils and equipment during food preparation, 
B. Cleaning and sanitizing food contact surfaces after each use, and 
C. Minimizing the time that potentially hazardous foods remain in the temperature danger 
zone of 40°F to 140°F?
Contextual Education 
When rental groups prepare and serve their own meals, instructions to help prevent 
contamination of foods may be posted or provided as part of information concerning use of the 
camp. 
“Sanitized utensils” must be cleaned and sanitized according to the guidelines in standard 
FA.17. “Food contact surfaces” means any surface that contacts raw food during preparation. 
Such surfaces should be sanitized with a bleach solution or other commercial sanitizer between 
times of use. 
The intent is to help ensure that foods are cooked and held at appropriate temperatures. People 
involved in food preparation should take appropriate safety precautions when holding, cooling, 
thawing, serving, or otherwise preparing food. Most states establish 140°F as the minimum 
temperature for holding potentially hazardous foods, whether in steam tables or on the stove. 
Camps should have the means and procedures to monitor temperatures periodically in the main 
food service operation area.

AD.41.1 - Does the camp advise rental groups, in writing, of any conditions for use, 
safety guidelines, supervision requirements, warnings, or restrictions for program 
activities, equipment, and facilities available to them?
Contextual Education 
“In writing” includes signs, trail markers, posted regulations or restrictions, and written materials 
provided to rental groups as appropriate. For some activities such as hiking or tennis, which are 
generally considered part of participants’ common experience, hours for use and precautions 
may be sufficient. Other activities such as horseback riding, cross-country skiing, or 
tobogganing may require more specific information or warnings about trail difficulty or 
hazardous conditions. 
Restrictions or conditions specified may be included in the written agreement with the rental 
group (AD.37 and AD.38). 
“Conditions for use” may include the use of participant waivers, permission forms, and 
expectations for behavior or proper use of equipment. Camps should specify ratios and type of 
supervisors required for specific activities or facilities, such as adult supervisors required for 
youth in recreation facilities. 
If the camp allows rental groups to use specialized activity facilities or equipment (e.g., archery 
equipment or ropes course elements) without camp staff leadership, supervisory requirements 
and conditions for use should at least be consistent with those specified in the standards for 
camp use.

services); 
C. Availability and storage of any first-aid supplies or equipment; and 
D. Training and information to be provided to staff, families, and user groups concerning 
emergency procedures and reporting requirements?
Contextual Education 
The intent is for camps to analyze their operations and make conscious decisions about their 
role in first aid or emergency care for rental groups, which may represent a range of concerns 
from cuts and scratches to massive trauma. In many cases, camps may determine that rental 
groups should be responsible for their own first aid, including first-aid supplies, and emergency 
transportation. Once those decisions are made, they must be communicated to user groups in 
the contract (see standard AD.37). 
“Reporting requirements,” in Part D, indicate that the camp should make a deliberate decision 
about what reports it expects to receive from staff and user groups concerning accidents, 
incidents, injuries, and illnesses.

FACILITIES 
The camp’s facilities, safety protocols, vehicles, and food service safety should promote health 
and safety and minimize risk. Facilities make an important contribution to the overall experience 
and significantly affect the safety of participants. 
Whether a camp’s program is held on a site owned, rented, or leased, and/or it uses owned, 
leased, charter, or commercial transportation, the program operator must be certain that 
provisions have been made for items in this section unless the “Does Not Apply” statement(s) 
indicates otherwise. 
The site and food service standards are: 
•Scored for camps using a base camp 
•Not scored for camps that run only extended trip/travel programs 
•Not scored for day camps with no base camp that are held each day on a different site 
FACILITIES: Site
These standards are not intended to be applied to homes or buildings that are on camp property 
that are used solely as private residences of staff, or applied to buildings that are not accessible 
to campers, rental groups, and/or staff. 
APPLICABILITY: Standards FA.1 through FA.11 do not apply if the camp is using a non-owned, 
ACA-accredited site.
APPLICABILITY: Standards FA.4 through FA.7 do not apply if the camp is conducted on a non-
owned, accredited or non-ACA-accredited site.  It is still important the camp administration 
consider the requirements of the standards in contracting with a rental site and verify as 
possible.

•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
•Short-term 
camps
•Camps serving 
rental groups
MANDATORY ALL
DNA: FA.1.1 and 
FA.1.2 do not apply if 
campers, staff, or

stay overnight in 
buildings.
DNA: FA.1.2 does not 
apply if all sleeping 
quarters are at ground 
level.
DNA: FA.1.1 and 
FA.1.2 do not apply if 
the camp is using a 
non-owned, ACA-
accredited site.
FA.1.1 - Are all buildings used for sleeping constructed or equipped with the following 
safety features:
At least one easily accessible emergency exit in addition to the main door or entrance 
and not immediately adjacent/next to the main door or entrance?
This standard may be met by providing a written statement from the local fire inspection 
authority stating the building is in full compliance with all local fire codes.  If the area in 
which the camp is located has no fire code, the standard must be met as written.
FA.1.2 - Are all buildings used for sleeping constructed or equipped with the following 
safety features:
A direct means of emergency exit to the outside from each sleeping floor not location on 
ground level?
This standard may be met by providing a written statement from the local fire inspection 
authority stating the building is in full compliance with all local fire codes.  If the area in 
which the camp is located has no fire code, the standard must be met as written. 
Contextual Education
"Buildings" for the purposes of this standard are permanent, enclosed structures that remain 
intact regardless of season.  Tents and Adirondack shelters are not considered buildings for the 
purposes of this standard.  This standard includes buildings used by campers, staff, or rental 
groups.  Day camps with overnights in buildings will also score this standard.
In FA.1.1, emergency exits should be located as far away and opposite the main entrances as 
possible so they could be used if the main entrance is blocked.  State or local fire officials or 
insurance underwriters may provide guidance as to what constitutes an acceptable escape 
plan. 
The emergency-exit needs of persons with disabilities should be considered.  Ground-level 
entrances should be accessible without the use of lifts or elevators to facilitate easy access and 
quick evacuation.  In split-level buildings with ground-level access on only one side, emergency 
exits from upper-level sleeping quarters must facilitate quick, safe evacuation for everyone in 
case the ground-level exit is blocked.
In FA.1.2, "to the outside" means that either the escape is on the outside of the building or an 
enclosed stairway exits directly to the outside at ground level.

FA.2 - CARE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
APPLICABILITY: Standards FA.1 through FA.11 do not apply if the camp is using a non-owned, 
ACA-accredited site.
Applies to:
•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
•Short-term 
camps
•Camps serving 
rental groups
MANDATORY
DNA: FA.2.1 does not 
apply if no flammable, 
explosive, poisonous 
materials or livestock 
medications are used 
or stored on site.  If 
livestock medication 
is used only for 
livestock involved in 
programming, score 
only PD.18.
DNA: FA.2.1 does not 
apply if the camp is 
using a non-owned 
ACA accredited site. 
 
FA.2.1 - Does the camp require that gas and liquid flammables, explosives, livestock 
medications, and other hazardous materials be: 
A. Handled only by individuals trained or experienced in their safe use and disposal 
using appropriate protective equipment such as gloves and masks; and 
B. Stored appropriately: 
1.With access limited to trained individuals, 
2.In closed, safe containers plainly labeled with content information, and 
3.In locations separate from food?
Contextual Education
Liquid flammables include gasoline, kerosene, and other liquid fuels.  Poisonous materials 
include cleaning agents, insecticides, weed killers, or other substances labeled as poisonous. 
 Medications used for livestock are often very potent due to the size of the animals for which 
they are developed.  To avoid accidental ingestion, campers should not have access to these 
items.
Regarding Part A of the standard, protective equipment such as gloves and masks must be 
provided when appropriate.  Individuals learning to use flammable or hazardous materials under 
the direct supervision of trained personnel would be in compliance with the standard. 
Regarding Part B of the standard, the camp may limit access to trained individuals by storing 
materials in areas off limits to all except designated staff; storing materials in locked buildings, 
rooms, cabinets, or containers; or training all participants on correct handling of certain 
materials (such as kerosene for lanterns or bleach for cleaning).  Large, easily recognizable, 
above-ground tanks, such as propane or gas tanks, do not need special labeling.  The intent of 
labeling is to prevent accidental, inappropriate use of flammable or poisonous substances.
Material safety data sheets (MSDS), available from suppliers and manufacturers, provide 
information on safe handling and disposal of hazardous materials.  Directors should be aware of 
local Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations regarding the 
availability and use of the MSDS.  Directors may also want to check with local officials (such as 
fire officials or insurance underwriters) for other recommendations concerning the storage and 
handling of flammable and poisonous substances.

FA.8.1 - Does the camp staff check all playground apparatus and related areas to verify 
that equipment is in good repair for use by campers?
Contextual Education
This standard applies to playgrounds on camp property and off-site.  A “playground” is a play 
area with constructed apparatus in a defined space on which campers swing, climb, slide, jump, 
and play in an unstructured way.  It does not include gymnastics or initiatives equipment in 
which an individual or group activity is directed, or an open field or games court.  A playground 
includes a single swing, tire swing or other “homemade” equipment and the related area to any 
such apparatus.
Staff should establish a schedule for checking playgrounds used by campers on a regular basis 
if used daily, or immediately prior to the experience if used only occasionally by campers. 
 Regular checks by staff of playground equipment, on the camp or off site, should verify, for 
example, that all equipment is moving freely, that structures are sound, that no sharp edges or 
points exist, and that loose-fill materials are in place on the surface around the playground.  
Camp owners/directors should be aware of any state/local regulations that specifically address 
playgrounds and inspection/safety requirements.

Constructed or equipped with smoke detection equipment in working order?
FA.10.2 - Are all buildings used for sleeping:
FA.10.2 Equipped with working CO detectors in any structure that contains fuel-burning 
equipment?
Contextual Education
This standard applies only to sleeping quarters located in buildings.  "Buildings," for the 
purposes of this standard, are permanent, enclosed structures that remain intact regardless of 
season.  Tents and Adirondack shelters are not considered buildings for the purposes of this 
standard.  This standard includes buildings used by campers, staff, or rental groups.  Day 
camps with overnights in buildings will also score this standard.  The situation of private 
residents is covered in the applicability statements. 
Part FA.10.2 of this standard applies to all enclosed structures that contain a combustible-fuel 
heat source (i.e., any kind of fuel that burns, and does not include electric heat units).  A CO 
detector should be installed on each floor of a building or structure used for sleeping, and within 
each bedroom if occupants sleep with a closed door.  The detector should be installed 
according to instructions specified with the equipment.

FA.11.1 - Does the camp require that upper bunks or beds, when the mattress base is 
more than 30 inches from the floor used by campers, be equipped with guardrails on 
each side of the bed (if the bed is attached to the wall no guardrail is required)?
Contextual Education
The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) defines a bunk bed as: "a bed with the 
bottom of its mattress foundation more than 30 inches above the floor.  The mattress foundation 
is the base or support on which you place the mattress."
Guardrails shall be attached so that they cannot be removed without either intentionally 
releasing a fastening device or applying forces sequentially in different directions. 
To prevent entrapment or choking, CPSC recommends that the bottom of the rail be no more 
than three and one-half (3½) inches from the top of the bed frame, and that the top of the rail be 
at least five (5) inches above the top of the mattress.

Written 
Documentation 
Required
DNA: FA.13.1 does 
not apply if the camp 
does not provide 
specialized program 
activities to include 
horseback riding and 
adventure/challenge 
areas.
FA.13.1 - Does the camp control access to all specialized program activity areas except 
when a group is actively supervised by a qualified adult activity leader?
Contextual Education
The intent of this standard is to prevent use of specialized activity areas by unauthorized or 
unsupervised persons, as well as to avoid potentially hazardous situations when the area is in 
use.  Access may be controlled through scheduling, education, or regulations, as well as with 
posted "off limits" signs, physical barriers, and dismantled equipment.
The definition of a “specialized program activity area” will vary based on the types of activities 
offered.  For example, if a camp offers adventure/challenge activities, access to activity areas 
including ropes courses, rappelling towers, and zip lines should be controlled.  In the context of 
horseback riding, access to stables, corrals, paddocks, and riding rings should be controlled.
“Actively supervised” means the qualified adult is present and monitoring the activity. 
 “Qualified” means the activity leader at least meets the requirements of standards ST.33. 
 Levels of qualification may vary due to the age of participants and content of the activity.

Facilities: 
Food Service
FACILITIES 
The camp’s facilities, safety protocols, vehicles, and food service safety should promote health 
and safety and minimize risk. Facilities make an important contribution to the overall experience 
and significantly affect the safety of participants. 
Whether a camp’s program is held on a site owned, rented, or leased, and/or it uses owned, 
leased, charter, or commercial transportation, the program operator must be certain that 
provisions have been made for items in this section unless the “Does Not Apply” statement(s) 
indicates otherwise. 
The site and food service standards are: 
•Scored for camps using a base camp 
•Not scored for camps that run only extended trip/travel programs 
•Not scored for day camps with no base camp that are held each day on a different site 
FACILITIES: Food Service 
The food service standards are intended to be applied to the camp’s regular food service system 
in day camps, resident camps, short-term programs, and rental groups for whom the camp 
provides meals, whether centralized in a dining hall(s) or decentralized in units. If someone other 
than the camp prepares meals, the food service standards would be scored if the camp is 
responsible for storage, serving, and cleanup of food; or if the camp is the sole user of the on-
site services (not one of many groups served as in a restaurant or dorm). 
However, even when the food service standards are not scored, camps should consider the 
requirements of the food service standards when contracting with appropriately licensed services 
and verifying their practices. 
Day camps in which campers and staff normally bring their own lunches and have only 
occasional cookouts or serve only drinks or snacks are required to score only FA.14, FA.15, and 
FA.16. 
If meals/snacks are not prepared or served in camp by the camp or by rental groups, or are 
prepared off site and/or served only on special occasions by a commercial kitchen for the camp 
or rental group, DNA FA.15 through FA.20 and ST.1. Camp must score FA.14. 
When rental groups use camp facilities to prepare their own meals, standards FA.14, FA.15, 
FA.16, AD.39, and AD.40 are required to be scored.
Standards FA.14 through FA.20 do not apply if the camp uses a non-owned, ACA-accredited 
site.
Standards FA.15 through FA.20 and standard ST.1 food service supervisor do not apply if the 
camp can produce a copy of a health inspection report that includes the kitchen. The report must 
indicate inspection has been conducted within the past 15 months resulting in a passing score. 
The camp is required to share a copy of the health inspection report indicating a passing score 
with the visitor to use the DNA option for this set of standards. Camp must score FA.14.

"Potentially hazardous foods" are those foods or ingredients, natural or synthetic, in a form 
capable of supporting growth of infectious or toxic microorganisms (i.e., milk or milk products, 
eggs, meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, edible crustaceans).  Such food should be maintained at 
temperatures below 40 degrees F.  Rental groups and camp staff should know to whom and 
how to report temperature problems in refrigerators so that prompt corrective action and 
alternate storage can be arranged.

FA.17.1 - Are food service staff required to minimize the time that potentially hazardous 
cooked foods remain in the food temperature danger zone of 40⁰F to 140⁰F?
Contextual Education
The intent is to help ensure that foods are cooked and held at appropriate temperatures.  Food 
service staff should take appropriate safety precautions when holding, cooling, thawing, serving, 
and so on.  Most states establish 140 degrees F as the minimum temperature for holding 
potentially hazardous foods whether in steam tables or on the stove.  "Potentially hazardous 
cooked foods" are those foods or ingredients, natural or synthetic, in a form capable of 
supporting growth of infectious or toxic microorganisms (e.g., milk or milk products, eggs, meat, 
poultry, fish, shellfish, edible crustaceans).  Camps should have the means and procedures to 
monitor temperatures periodically wherever food is served by food service staff.

Facilities: 
Transportation
FACILITIES 
The camp’s facilities, safety protocols, vehicles, and food service safety should promote health 
and safety and minimize risk. Facilities make an important contribution to the overall experience 
and significantly affect the safety of participants. 
Whether a camp’s program is held on a site owned, rented, or leased, and/or it uses owned, 
leased, charter, or commercial transportation, the program operator must be certain that 
provisions have been made for items in this section unless the “Does Not Apply” statement(s) 
indicates otherwise. 
The site and food service standards are: 
•Scored for camps using a base camp 
•Not scored for camps that run only extended trip/travel programs 
•Not scored for day camps with no base camp that are held each day on a different site 
FACILITIES: Transportation 
Whether owned or leased, any vehicles provided by the camp and used to transport campers 
and/or staff must be maintained in safe operating condition. 
All camps must score FA.21 whether they provide transportation or not.
Transportation standards apply to any and all transportation of campers, staff, or rental group 
members provided by, planned for, or arranged by the camp, whether in owned, leased, private, 
or commercial land vehicles. This includes as examples: 
•Camp-arranged transportation to and from camp 
•Transportation to activity sites such as pools, stables, lakes, or vendor-provided 
programs 
•Transportation for day trips or field trips 
•Transportation for non-emergency doctor visits (even the occasional visit) 
•Transportation to trip sites and within the trip/travel program itself 
•Group transportation in any kind of passenger vehicle, including bus, van, SUV, and car
These standards do not apply to use of regularly scheduled public transportation (e.g., trains, 
limos, buses, taxis, Uber) or to watercraft transportation, such as ferries, whose operations are 
subject to local or other regulations. They do not apply to rental groups that provide their own 
transportation.
These standards are not scored for camp maintenance vehicles (e.g., tractors, trucks, golf carts) 
unless they are used to transport persons other than maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, 
health supervisors, or administrative staff. However, camps are advised to consider the 
requirements of transportation standards when establishing guidelines for any vehicle used 
within the camp operation.
Standard FA.22 applies to any and all land transportation of campers, staff, or rental group 
members planned by, planned for, or arranged by the camp, including charter vehicles with hired 
drivers.
Standards FA.23 and FA.24 are scored for all transportation provided by and for the camp when 
the camp provides drivers, whether the vehicles are owned, leased, rented, or borrowed. They 
do not apply to rental groups providing their own transportation.

Contextual Education
When checking tires for proper inflation, staff should be especially careful to determine the 
proper tire inflation by the tire type and size, or one that is established by the manufacturer’s 
guidelines for the vehicle.  For an accurate read the vehicle should be parked for three or more 
hours prior to checking the tire pressure. 
Directors should check local codes for frequency of safety checks required for the items in this 
standard. A checklist should be used to verify compliance with this standard.

Health and 
Wellness
HEALTH AND WELLNESS 
Camps vary in their healthcare needs based on clientele, type and length of program, number of 
trained healthcare providers on the camp staff, and distance from professional medical facilities. 
 Camps need to determine what type of healthcare provider and healthcare plan are in the best 
interest based on these factors. 
All camps need a well-thought-out healthcare plan that provides for the needs of campers, staff, 
and rental groups. Potential health risks to the clientele need to be identified and evaluated, and 
plans for prevention and care need to be specified.
Depending on the type of programs and services the camp offers throughout the year, camps 
may need to address the requirements of standards for several types of camp operations. When 
a camp seeking accreditation provides day camp, resident camp, short-term resident camp, 
trip/travel camp, and/or leases to rental groups at any time during the year, the applicable health 
and wellness standards must be scored (NOTE:  Refer to standards in the Administration 
Section when rental groups are served).
The American Camp Association standards define minimums in terms of staff, facilities, and 
procedures for healthcare. They also allow for flexibility in determining the specifics of healthcare 
planning.
Several designated standards are not scored for nonmedical religious campers or camps.

MANDATORY
Written 
Documentation 
Required
HW.1.1 - Does the camp require each camper to submit a current, signed health history 
that includes all of the following information in relation to the activities in which the 
camper may participate?
A.  Record of allergies and/or dietary restrictions;
B.  Record of current medications, both prescribed and over-the-counter;
C.  Record of past health treatment, if any;
D.  A statement from the custodial parent/guardian attesting that all immunizations 
required for school are up to date including the actual date (month/year) of last tetanus 
shot (a physician statement, a government immunization report, or a school 
immunization report is also acceptable); 
E.  Description of any current physical, mental, emotional, social health, developmental, 
or psychological conditions requiring medication, treatment, or special restrictions or 
considerations while at camp; and    
F.  Description of any camp activities the camper should be exempted from for health 
reasons?
Contextual Education
A “health history” is a current record of one’s past and present health status completed and 
signed by an adult camper or the parent/guardian of a minor.  “Current” means prepared 
specifically for the camp season.
The required signature serves as evidence that the adult camper or the custodial 
parent/guardian has supplied complete and accurate health information related to the camper’s 
participation in specific activities as outlined in AD.33.
NOTE: If camps have minors who do not have immunizations — for religious or other reasons 
— camps may allow a signed waiver or refusal.

A.  Signed permission to provide routine healthcare services, administer medications, 
and seek emergency services; or
B.  A signed waiver refusing permission to treat by the custodial parent/guardian?
Contextual Education
“Routine healthcare” may include, but is not limited to, those treatment procedures addressed in 
standard HW.9.  Regarding the administration of medications, some states require parental 
permission even for caregivers to administer over-the-counter medications such as analgesics, 
cough syrup, and topical ointments.
Camp directors should be aware of the privacy and confidentiality issues they need to address 
and if/how the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) might impact them.
If parents or guardians refuse to sign a permission-to-treat form for religious or other reasons, 
the camp should have a signed form specifying action to be taken if the camper needs care or 
treatment and releases the camp from liability if the parent or guardian cannot be reached in an 
emergency.

HW.5 - HEALTH EXAM
Applies to: 
•Resident 
camps
Written 
Documentation 
Required
DNA: HW.5.1 and 
HW.5.2 do not apply 
to nonmedical 
religious camps.
DNA: HW.5.2 does 
not apply if the camp 
has completed their 
assessment and does 
not require a health 
exam.
 
HW.5.1 - Does the camp:
Assess and determine the need for campers to have a physical exam by an appropriately 
licensed healthcare provider?
HW.5.2 - Does the camp:
Require completion of the health exam within the previous 24 months?
Contextual Education
Based on a camp’s location and program offerings, the camp should consider the need for each 
participant to have a current health exam, taking into account factors such as the level of 
physical exertion, length of the program, distance from EMS, and other variables.  The risk 
profile for some individuals and/or the risk profile of some camp programs may indicate the 
need for a physical exam that attests to the person’s ability to safely participate in the program. 
 If the camp determines such an exam is warranted, the camp should provide a health exam 
form to parents for completion.  Camps should also be aware that some state regulations 
require completion of a physical (health exam).  Consequently, even if ACA standards do not 
require an exam, a camp in such a state would need to respond to the state regulation.
"Licensed healthcare provider" includes licensed prescribers and in some states includes 
physician’s assistants and certified nurse practitioners or other healthcare providers licensed by 
the state in which the camp is located.

HW.6 - HEALTH SCREENING FOR RESIDENT CAMPS
Applies to: 
•Resident 
camps
Written 
Documentation 
Required
DNA: HW.6.1 does 
not apply to 
nonmedical religious 
camps.
HW.6.1 - Do campers undergo a health screening within twenty-four (24) hours of first 
arrival at camp that: 
A. Is conducted by individuals with these qualifications: 
1.For camps not primarily serving campers with special medical needs, a licensed 
healthcare provider or an adult following specific written instructions provided by 
a licensed prescriber; or 
2.For camps primarily serving persons with special medical needs, a licensed 
healthcare provider? 
B. And the health screening includes: 
1.A check for observable evidence of illness, injury, and/or communicable disease 
or conditions (such as lice); 
2.Verification and updating of health history information to identify any medication, 
changes in health status, or special needs that may require further follow-up; 
3.Review and collection of any medications to be administered during the camper’s 
stay at camp; and 
4.Documentation of results of screening for each camper?
Contextual Education
The purpose of the screening is to verify and update the health history received from each 
camper prior to participation in camp activities, and to assure that the camp staff is prepared to 
respond to any specific healthcare needs of campers.
"Licensed healthcare provider" includes licensed prescribers and in some states includes 
physician’s assistants and certified nurse practitioners or other healthcare providers licensed by 
the state in which the camp is located.
Written documentation of the screening is to record (1) that the screening took place and (2) 
exam results.  It can be as simple as a check mark on the health form that verifies that 
information is current, with notations regarding any changes.  Any significant findings during 
screening would require more detailed information.  The documentation should be signed and 
dated by screening personnel.
“Further follow-up” may include not only advising appropriate staff of specific needs, allergies, or 
restrictions, but also contacting parents or health professionals to gather further information to 
help provide a successful camp experience.
Additional health review and screening considerations for extended trip/travel camps may be 
required based on the type and length of a trip, and time between initial screening and the start 
of the trip.

DNA: HW.9.2 E does 
not apply if a 
nonmedical religious 
camp or if all 
healthcare for all 
programs is provided 
by licensed

practitioners.
HW.9.1 - Are healthcare policies and/or procedures for each type of camp operation:
Reviewed at least every three (3) years by a licensed healthcare professional whose 
scope of practice allows such a review?
HW.9.2 - Are healthcare policies and/or procedures for each type of camp operation:
Written so they include:
A.  Scope and limits of camp healthcare services provided, including qualifications and 
locations of personnel;
B.  Authority and responsibilities of the camp healthcare administrator and provider;
C.  Authority and responsibilities of other camp staff to provide health and emergency 
care;
D.  Guidelines for when to access additional external medical and mental health 
resources; and
E.  Treatment procedures allowed under the scope of practice of the designated 
healthcare provider(s) for dealing with reasonably anticipated illnesses and injuries?
Contextual Education
“Each type of camp operation” refers to day camp, resident camp, short-term camp, and 
extended trip/travel programs.  Concerns for rental groups are addressed in standard AD.43 but 
may also be included here.  The “review” should include the camp’s administrative staff and the 
camp's healthcare administrator and staff.
A healthcare professional’s “scope of practice” is typically defined by law/license and defines 
the procedures, actions, and processes permitted for that licensed individual.  The individual’s 
scope of practice is limited to that which the law allows for specific education and experience, 
and defined demonstrated competency.
“Scope and limits” refers to the specific healthcare services provided to individuals and groups 
served by the camp, such as summer youth camps and trips.  The policies should define what is 
and what is not provided in terms of services and personnel (including personnel qualifications). 
 Camps also need to evaluate where (on and off site) they may need first-aid or health certified 
personnel, based on characteristics of participants, location of the activity, and type of activity.
The “authority and responsibility of the healthcare administrator and provider” should define 
whether these two functions are held by the same person.  Camps with separate administrative 
and provider functions should define the responsibilities for each position.  Job description(s) 
may be used to meet this requirement.
Written materials should identify names, locations, and phone numbers of additional health 
resources.  When campers from a nonmedical religious tradition are part of the population, the 
camp’s materials should include appropriate contacts for health problems of nonmedical 
religious campers.
Mental health resources may include crisis team support, providing an opportunity for emotional 
support, and debriefing as needed following critical incidents.  This may also include 
psychologists, psychiatrists, clergy, and hotline numbers.
“Treatment procedures” include those that are commonly accepted and appropriate to the 
© 2019 American Camping Association, Inc. November 2019100 of 208

healthcare provider’s credentials when providing care for illnesses or injuries.  This may also 
include general first-aid guidelines and identify situations when professional medical treatment 
or advice should be sought.  Camps with both licensed health center staff and non-licensed 
(tripping) staff should consider two separate treatment procedures, each reflecting the scope of 
the staff member’s credential (e.g., first-aid certified vs. nurse licensed).
Procedures for care and treatment should be appropriate for the scope of practice of personnel 
providing healthcare in the camp (e.g., nurse, EMT, first-aider) and should be specific to 
reasonably anticipated camp injuries and illnesses.  Because accepted practices and 
medications change frequently, these procedures and protocols should be reviewed annually to 
determine acceptability with current practice.  The camp's healthcare provider should be present 
to review the procedures when possible.
Note:  Treatment procedures may need to be signed annually depending on the scope of 
practice and/or credentials of the camp’s healthcare provider.

Contextual Education
All appropriate staff members should be informed of camper physical, mental, emotional, social, 
and developmental needs or restrictions of campers under their supervision, whether in the 
cabin or in program activities.
This may include information on diet, allergies, medication, rest requirements, and activity 
restrictions; recognition and care of potential medical problems such as choking, seizures, and 
hypoglycemia; care and handling of campers with wheelchairs, prosthetic and orthopedic 
devices; and care of individual campers with any other specialized needs or behavioral

B.  Procedures for obtaining emergency healthcare assistance?
Contextual Education
“Equipment and supplies” identifies any healthcare and emergency equipment including first-aid 
kits that will be maintained on site.  This will vary based on the camp’s clientele, staffing pattern 
for healthcare, and distance to additional medical resources.  Camps may consider having first-
aid kits available at locations where a person certified in first aid is required.
Procedures should be identified for how individuals, on or off site, can “obtain emergency 
healthcare assistance,” including while in remote areas on the camp property and locations 
used for overnight or day trips.  Staff should be trained in these procedures.

HW.13 - MEDICATION STORAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Applies to: 
•Day camps

camps
•Short-term 
camps
MANDATORY
Written 
Documentation 
Required
DNA: HW.13.1 does 
not apply if no drugs 
are kept in camp or 
carried on trips.  Does 
not apply to insulin if 
the camp primarily 
serves campers with 
diabetes and the 
written camp 
philosophy of 
diabetes 
management requires 
self-administration of 
insulin.
HW.13.1 - Does the camp require all drugs to be stored under lock except when in the 
controlled possession of the person responsible for administering them:
A.  For prescription drugs — given only under the specific directions of a licensed 
prescriber;
B.  For nonprescription drugs — given per the camp’s written procedures (see standard 
HW.9) or under the signed instruction of the custodial parent/guardian as allowed or the 
individual's licensed prescriber?
Note: Exceptions would be for a limited amount of medication for life-threatening 
conditions carried by a camper or staff person (e.g., bee sting medication or inhaler) or 
limited medications approved for storage in first-aid kits.
Contextual Education
The intent of this standard is to assure that all medications belonging to both campers and staff 
members be stored under control of the camp healthcare provider or trip staff.
Any drugs from staff members submitted to the healthcare staff should be accepted in a manner 
that does not require the staff member to disclose the type of medication that he/she is taking 
unless: (a) a staff member chooses to share this information voluntarily; or (b) the medication 
could impair the staff member’s ability to perform the essential functions of their position, in 
which case a discussion should occur and reasonable accommodation be considered.  Staff 
members will need to “self-medicate” should they not share what medication is being stored. 
 Any knowledge of prescription medication taken by staff must be kept in the strictest of 
confidence and shared only on a specific need-to-know basis.  Camp staff medication can be 
locked in a separate area provided specifically for them (such as a locker).  The intent is to have 
medication secure and unavailable to anyone other than to whom it is prescribed or for whom it 
is purchased (over the counter).
Drugs should be locked in a cabinet or storage box at all times.  In cases where there is full-time 
licensed healthcare professional/staff and the healthcare facility or first-aid area is in a 
permanent building, it is acceptable to have the entire building or room where medication is kept 
locked when not under direct supervision of the healthcare staff.  Drugs requiring refrigeration 
may be stored in a locked refrigerator or in a locked container within the refrigerator.
Medications include all prescription medications, as well as all over-the-counter drugs that are 
potentially hazardous if misused (e.g., Tylenol, cold tablets).  They can also include herbal 
remedies.  "Controlled possession" means under the immediate and direct supervision or 
control of the person taking the medication or of a staff member.  "Specific directions of a 
licensed prescriber" include directions on an original prescription bottle, a note on the signed 
health examination record, or something in writing from a licensed prescriber.
The only camps who may choose “does not apply” to the insulin portion of this standard are 
camps primarily serving campers with diabetes (i.e., more than 50 percent of enrolled campers 
are diabetic), or where the camp educational philosophy of diabetes management specifies that 
camper control of insulin is part of the training program.

HW.14 - RECORDKEEPING
Applies to: 
•Day camps
•Resident

Written 
Documentation 
Required
HW.14.1 - Does the camp maintain:
A recordkeeping system in which at least the following information is permanently 
recorded:
A. Date, time, and legal name of the injured or ill person;
B. General description of injury or illness;
C. Description of treatment (if administered), including any treatment administered away 
from the healthcare facility;
D. Administration of all medications; and
E. Initials of person evaluating and treating?
HW.14.2 - Does the camp maintain:
Reports of all health incidents resulting in injury requiring professional medical 
treatment?
Contextual Education
An appropriate recordkeeping system should be developed by the camp that captures the 
information listed above and any other pertinent data (e.g., attempts to contact parents or 
contact with external healthcare providers on behalf of the camper or staff member).  A bound 
book with preprinted page numbers and lined pages is frequently used to meet Part A of this 
standard.  Such a system is particularly helpful when many people keep health records, or when 
records are kept by individuals without extensive medical training.  Any system used should be 
reviewed by medical and legal counsel.  Camps should keep separate records for campers and 
staff to meet OSHA regulations.  Computerized records are acceptable under this standard only 
when there is a method of ascertaining when records have been altered.
The camp system should also include a method for capturing health records generated when a 
group is away from the camp’s main health center.
The administration of medications on a daily, routine schedule to a number of campers and/or 
staff may be recorded on one form specific to that camp session and appended to the health 
records for that group or individual.
Regarding HW.14.2 of the standard, "professional medical treatment" includes all medical 
attention by or consultation with a licensed prescriber following an injury or incident.

Written 
Documentation 
Required
DNA: HW.15.1 A, B, 
and C do not apply to 
short-term programs.
HW.15.1 - Does the camp request each seasonal staff member to submit a current, 
signed health history (and qualified medical personnel’s statement if the camp requires a 
physical) that includes the following information: 
A. Based on the staff member’s job description, clarification of any camp activities from 
which the staff member should be exempted or limited for health reasons as indicated by 
a qualified medical personnel (only required if the camp requires staff to have a health 
exam); 
B. Date (month/year) of last tetanus shot; 
C. A statement indicating if the staff member requires any medication that might impair 
their ability to perform the essential functions of their position (if so, the staff member 
must discuss details with the camp healthcare provide); 
D. Record of allergies;
E. Whom to contact in case of emergency; and 
F. Permission to treat in case of emergency?
Contextual Education 
A “health history” is a current record of one’s past and present health status that is completed 
and signed by the staff member (or by a custodial adult if staff member is a minor). “Current” 
means prepared specifically for the camp season. 
The required signature serves as evidence that the staff member has supplied complete and 
accurate health information related to the job description. 
Disclosure by the staff of a medical condition or medication that could impair his/her ability to 
perform the essential functions of the position may indicate that the staff member is entitled to a 
reasonable accommodation under the ADA. The camp should consult legal counsel with any 
questions and/or concerns. Such disclosure should also be treated with the strictest of 
confidence and be shared only on a specific need-to-know basis. 
Note: If camps have staff members who do not have immunizations, for religious or other 
reasons, a “record” can be a signed refusal or a signed waiver form. 
If staff members refuse to sign a permission-to-treat form, for religious or other reasons, the 
camp should have a signed form that specifies action to be taken if the person needs care or 
treatment and releases the camp from liability.

B. And screening includes: 
1.A check for observable evidence of illness, injury, or communicable diseases or 
condition; 
2.Verification of and update to health history information to identify changes in 
health status, or special needs that may require follow-up?
Contextual Education 
The purpose of the screening is to verify and update the health history received from each staff 
member prior to participation in camp activities. “Licensed prescriber” includes licensed 
prescribers and in some states, physician’s assistants and certified nurse practitioners, or other 
healthcare provider, licensed by the state in which the camp is located to conduct health 
examinations. 
The staff health screening is a time to ascertain if the staff member can meet the essential 
functions of their job. At the camp’s discretion and in addition to physical evaluation, screening 
of any mental health concerns may also be completed (i.e., questioning, review of meds).

any vehicles for 
camper transport.
HW.18.1 - In addition to the healthcare center, is a first-aid kit stocked with supplies 
appropriate to the location and activity, including personal protective equipment, readily 
available at these locations (where applicable): 
A. Aquatic areas; 
B. Specialized activity areas; 
C. Out-of-camp trips; 
D. Food service areas; and 
E. Vehicle(s)? 
 
Contextual Education 
The extent of first-aid supplies immediately available to first-aiders may depend on the location 
of additional emergency help and supplies and the credentials and training of providers using 
the kit. Camps should also have a biohazard clean-up kit readily accessible for each aquatic 
and kitchen area. For example, a first-aid kit at the lake or river may need to be more extensive 
than one at a pool located next to the camp health center. Staff-supervised groups going off site 
must be sure to carry appropriate emergency supplies. 
“Personal protective equipment” to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens should include 
at least a pocket mask or other breathing barrier and disposable gloves.

Staff and 
Supervision: 
Qualifications
STAFF AND SUPERVISION 
The key to any camp’s success is its personnel. One of the unique features of a camp is the vital 
and all-encompassing leadership role demanded of its personnel in the camp community. Camp 
personnel are expected to assume many responsibilities, deliver a wide range of services, and 
complete numerous tasks in an environment of constant close human interaction, all with quality 
results. Some persons may work with the site operation, some with the program, and some with 
both. 
The physical, emotional, and mental well-being of campers is of utmost importance. This can be 
more readily accomplished when a camp has a system that includes clearly identified staff 
qualifications, well-planned staff training, and appropriate supervision of campers and staff. The 
requirements included in the standards vary according to the nature of the positions in question. 
Personnel to be considered in scoring this section of standards include: 
•Volunteer and paid staff involved with the operation of both the site and programming; 
•Volunteer and paid staff who are supervised by the camp operator/director; and
•Volunteer and paid staff for which the camp operator/director has overall responsibility for 
selection, training, supervision, and dismissal. 
Generally, these standards do not apply to consultants (unless otherwise noted in a specific 
standard), workshop leaders, and other personnel who are not part of the camp’s staff. However, 
administrators should consider the requirements of the human resources standards in utilizing 
such persons. 
As with all standards, it is important to read the “Does Not Apply” statement to determine 
applicability for your camp.

never applicable. 
DNA: ST.2.1, ST.2.2, 
ST.2.3, and ST.2.4 do

ST.2.1 - Does the camp have a designated healthcare provider on site who: 
For day camps and short-term camps, is a licensed prescriber or registered nurse on site 
daily, or does the camp have access by phone or video to a licensed prescriber or 
registered nurse with whom prior written arrangements have been made to provide 
prompt consultation and other healthcare support to the camp?
ST.2.2 - Does the camp have a designated healthcare provider on site who: 
For resident camps, is a licensed prescriber or registered nurse:
A. On-site daily— either continually or at some point throughout the day to conduct in-
person consultation with the on-site healthcare provider; or 
B. Available for a pre-arranged daily video “chat” with the camp 
healthcare provider to provide consultation and support?
ST.2.3 - Does the camp have a designated healthcare provider on site who: 
For camp sessions primarily serving individuals with special medical needs, is the 
provider a licensed prescriber or registered nurse?
ST.2.4 - Does the camp have a designated healthcare provider on site who: 
For nonmedical religious camps, is a provider an individual meeting qualifications 
specified in writing by the religious program?
Contextual Education 
In ST.2.1, “access by phone” should be to a specific licensed prescriber or registered nurse who 
is familiar with the camp’s healthcare needs. Access to a 911 emergency phone system or “Call 
a Nurse” (or similar) does not qualify as access to specific medical personnel providing ongoing 
consultation to oversee camp health. 
In ST.2.2, “daily consultation” should include checking current health concerns or recent 
treatments and reviewing the health log and incident/accident reports. 
“On the camp site daily” or “daily video chat” refers to a time each day when a person so 
licensed is on the property or available via video to consult with the healthcare staff. This 
individual—someone with healthcare or medical training—will evaluate camp health practices, 
review the medication log, and consult about trends and concerns to provide advice and input 
on current health and wellness concerns to the designated healthcare provider in camp. The 
video chat can be through an established tele-medical service or through another video chat 
service (Skype, Zoom, etc.)
Registered nurses and licensed prescribers are qualified to meet this standard only if they are 
© 2019 American Camping Association, Inc. November 2019114 of 208

permanently or temporarily licensed or recognized by the state in which the camp is located. As 
a general rule, professional healthcare staff trained abroad are not permitted to fulfill the 
functions of a doctor or nurse until they have completed state board examinations and are 
licensed in the state. If using video chat, it is important to confirm the licensing status of that 
individual to practice in the state in which the camp is located. 
For camps primarily serving persons with special medical needs, provision must be made for 
similarly qualified substitutes when the licensed prescriber or registered nurse must be away 
from camp for more than twelve (12) hours in a resident camp, or more than one day in a day 
camp. 
In nonmedical religious camps, there must be a person on duty designated to handle health and 
incident/accident situations who meets the qualifications specified in writing by the religious 
body.

Required 
DNA: ST.3.1, ST.3.2, 
and/or ST.3.3 do not 
apply if camp types or 
locations specified are 
never applicable. 
ST.3.1 - Does the camp require an adult with the following minimum qualifications to be 
on duty at all times when campers are present: 
When access to the emergency medical system (EMS) is 30 minutes or less, certification 
by a recognized provider of training in first aid and CPR/AED (cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator)?
ST.3.2 - Does the camp require an adult with the following minimum qualifications to be 
on duty at all times when campers are present: 
When access to emergency rescue systems or EMS is more than 30 minutes, 
certification from a recognized provider of training in wilderness first aid and CPR/AED?
ST.3.3 - Does the camp require an adult with the following minimum qualifications to be 
on duty at all times when campers are present: 
For nonmedical religious camps, an individual meeting qualifications specified in writing 
by the religious sponsor?
Contextual Education 
“On duty at all times” means that the appropriately certified or licensed person is available in 
camp or on the trip, and staff or campers know how to contact them. 
“Access to the emergency medical system (EMS)” means how long it would take before a 
person could receive a higher level of medical assistance at the site of the incident/accident. 
When a camp offers trips (both short and long) off site, higher levels of certification may be 
required depending on the trips and anticipated access to emergency services. Camps should 
consider personnel requirements on all out-of-camp trips in relation to the distance requirements 
of this standard. 
Camps should evaluate their location, clientele, and activities, and provide person(s) with a 
higher level of training to provide emergency first-aid coverage, if appropriate. CPR certification 
must be appropriate for the age of the campers served.

DNA: ST.4.1 does not 
apply if there are 
never hikes, trips, or 
activity locations 
where the camp 
healthcare provider is 
not immediately 
available.
ST.4.1 - For any out-of-camp trips or activity locations or situations where the camp 
healthcare provider is not present or nearby, does the camp require that a staff member 
with current first-aid and CPR/ AED certification be designated and immediately available 
who has been oriented to: 
A. Provide for routine healthcare needs for the designated group of participants; and 
B. Handle life-threatening emergencies related to the health conditions of the 
participants and the environmental hazards associated with the area?
Contextual Education 
This standard applies to overnights, out-of-camp trips, or activity locations some distance from 
help in case of an emergency, as well as to times when the camp healthcare provider is on a 
day off or is out of camp. 
Orientation for staff members may include instructions concerning medications for group 
participants, any restrictions for group members, and general health instructions related to the 
activity (e.g., precautions and treatment for sunburn, dehydration, altitude sickness, and 
hypothermia). 
“Life-threatening emergencies” refers to reasonably expected potential emergencies related to 
known health conditions of the participants for a particular activity. If a child has epilepsy, for 
instance, a staff member should be trained in how to handle seizures; if a child is known to be 
allergic to bee stings, a staff member should be oriented to deal with that need.

Contextual Education 
“On duty” means readily available to render needed assistance. 
For specialized activities, the certified staff member may be from the camp, vendor, or the rental 
group. Camps must advise rental groups of requirements in a contract or other written 
instruction (see AD.37, AD.38, and AD.41). See PD section applicability and glossary for the 
specialized program activity definition.
For aquatic activities, the certified staff member may be from the camp or the rental group. 
Camps must advise rental groups of requirements in a contract or other written instruction (see 
AD.37, AD.38, and AD.41). When swimming and/or watercraft aquatic activity supervision is 
vendor-provided or use public facilities camps must score AD.46 and/or AD.47.
Based on the location of the activity site in relation to additional medical support, a camp should 
consider if someone in addition to the lifeguard/ supervising staff member should have current 
first-aid and CPR/AED certification. 
For nonmedical religious camps, a person meeting the qualifications specified in writing by the 
religious program to meet emergency situations must be on duty and accessible.

C. Has documented experience of engaging in said activity within the past two years? 
OR
D. If the supervisor does not possess a current certification, is the verification of 
documented supervisor training and documented experience of engaging in the activity 
within the past two years available?
Contextual Education 
Supervisors qualifications for adventure/challenge, horseback riding, and aquatic activities are 
scored in ST.9, ST.10, and ST.11 respectively and are NOT SCORED here in ST.8.
The intent of this standard is to assure that at least one person in camp who is certified, 
documented, and/or experienced in each of the activities offered is providing supervision for 
conduct of each identified activity. This individual needs the knowledge and experience to make 
judgments concerning participants, equipment, facilities, safety considerations, supervision, 
execution, and procedures for the activity. This supervisor also needs to provide training and 
supervision to enable specialized activity leaders to carry out their responsibilities but does not 
necessarily need to be present at each activity. 
The camp is responsible for meeting Part A and either Parts B and C or Part D. Documentation 
of training must be available for each type of activity if more than one is identified (e.g., archery 
and riflery). 
Camps that use vendor-provided personnel for specialized activities score AD.45.1.

ST.10.2 - Does the camp provide:
An overall supervisor for horseback riding facilities, staff, and program operations who 
has experience of at least four (4) weeks of management or supervisory experience at a 
horseback riding facility in the past three (3) years?
Contextual Education 
In ST.10.1-B, “instructor” in this standard refers to completion of courses that require skills and 
competency in riding with a focus on riding instruction techniques, safety, and stable 
management. Check the ACA website, ACAcamps. org, for certifying bodies. 
“Documented endorsements” may include letters of reference from former employers, students, 
or coworkers, as well as brochures or advertisements identifying programs where the individual 
is listed as an instructor. “Formal horseback riding instruction” requires that the program for 
which the individual served as an instructor was an established program that followed a 
systematic course of training and required demonstration of prescribed levels of knowledge and 
competency. 
In ST.10.2, “experience” should represent a background in supervising a total operation, 
including instruction, stable management, care and feeding of horses, scheduling, staff 
supervision, and equipment care. Experience assisting a supervisor in a similar program is also 
sufficient to meet the requirements of this standard if that experience includes all aspects of the

1.Lifeguard training from a recognized certifying body; 
2.Instructor or instructor trainer rating from a recognized boating or watercraft 
organization; or 
3.Equivalent certification?

A supervisor for the program operation of each aquatic area (to include supervising 
staff) who has experience or training of at least four (4) weeks previously in a 
management or supervisory position at a similar aquatic area in the past three (3) years, 
or has completed additional aquatics management or supervisory training from a 
nationally recognized aquatics organization within the past three (3) years?
Contextual Education 
Separate aquatic activities in camp, such as swimming and watercraft activities, may have 
separate staff members serving in this function, or one person may be supervising all aquatic 
areas. 
Although current certification is preferred, a qualified, experienced individual to oversee and 
administer aquatics programs is more important. Certification alone does not indicate that an 
individual has administrative experience in the broader aspects of aquatic management.
“Additional aquatics management or supervision training” goes beyond lifeguard training and is 
intended to provide training in facility and equipment management and personnel supervision. 
Check ACA’s website, ACAcamps.org, for a list of recognized certifying bodies.

surveillance, and in close enough proximity to participants to readily respond and 
execute rescue in an incident/emergency?
ST.12.2 - To guard each swimming activity, does the camp:
In addition to lifeguard certification, does the camp document that every camp lifeguard 
has demonstrated skills in rescue and emergency procedures specific to the camp’s 
swimming area(s) and activities guarded?
ST.12.3 - AND/OR 
To guard each swimming activity, does the camp:
Advise each rental group in writing to provide an individual with current certification as a 
lifeguard by a recognized certifying body?
Contextual Education 
This standard applies to non-staffed public facilities (e.g., hotel pool, state park, beach) as well 
as in-camp facilities. In these situations, camps use their own staff, who must meet the 
requirements of this standard. It also applies to both instructional and recreational swimming 
activities. 
ACA strongly recommends a guard has certification specific to the environment they will be 
guarding (e.g., waterfront, waterpark, pool). 
The intent of this standard is to confirm lifeguards can execute not only the skills represented by 
the certification but also to be sure that lifeguards have the appropriate training and skills to 
perform rescues specific to the location, type of water, and activities for which they will be 
guarding. In some cases, additional certification may be required, as in surf or whitewater 
conditions. These skills must be observed, verified, and documented by qualified personnel. 
“Qualified personnel” is someone with current and documented experience in lifeguard 
instruction, lifeguard evaluation, and/or assessment for the type of water and activities offered. 
Check the ACA website, ACAcamps.org, for recognized certifying bodies.
Camps that use vendor-provided personnel for swimming activities score AD.46 and/or AD.47.

current divemaster certification from a recognized certifying body?
Contextual Education 
Because supervision and rescue skills required for SCUBA diving activities are specialized and 
different than those for other aquatic activities, the certifications for the supervising adult must 
be appropriate to the activity.

ST.14.3 - For all instructional swimming activities:
Are rental groups advised in writing to provide a lifeguard out of the water continuously 
to watch over the activity if the instructor is in the water with participants? 
Contextual Education 
A swimming instructor does not necessarily have lifeguard certification. If the instructor is not 
also a lifeguard, an additional certified lifeguard is necessary to maintain compliance with 
mandatory standard(s) ST.12 and/or AD.46. If the lifeguard is in the water instructing 
participants, an additional lifeguard must be guarding the activity. 
Standards ST.14.1 and ST.14.2 apply if camp uses vendor-provided lifeguard for swimming 
activities (AD.46). ST.14.1 swim instructor can be provided by the vendor or camp.

A. Current instructor rating in the appropriate craft from a recognized certifying body; or 
B. Current lifeguard training from a nationally recognized certifying body; or 
C. Other acceptable certification or license?
ST.15.2 - To guard each watercraft activity for day and resident camp programs and for 
youth groups, does the camp provide: 
In addition to certification used to meet ST.15.1, does the camp require that every camp 
watercraft guard demonstrate skill in water rescue and emergency procedures for the 
type of water and activities conducted?
ST.15.3 - To guard each watercraft activity for day and resident camp programs and for 
youth groups, does the camp provide: 
When the camp is serving a rental group, is the rental group advised in writing to provide 
a person with this training and/ or certification:
A. Current instructor rating in the appropriate craft from a recognized certifying body; or 
B. Current lifeguard training from a recognized certifying body; or 
C. Other acceptable certification or license?
Contextual Education 
All watercraft activities in day and resident camps must have an appropriately certified person 
on duty with rescue skills appropriate to the activity and aquatic location. Watercraft guards 
must be positioned in locations where they are able to provide effective surveillance, and in 
close enough proximity to participants to readily respond and execute rescue in an 
incident/emergency. Because most lifeguard training courses are pool based, camps must be 
certain staff members also have appropriate boating training and rescue skills. 
“Skill in water rescue and emergency procedures” refers to the ability to execute rescue skills in 
the location of the activity (e.g., lake, ocean, river) and specific to the watercraft being 
supervised. Certification courses to meet lifeguard requirements often do not include rescue and 
emergency training specific to the craft and location; therefore, camps may need to provide or 
arrange for additional skills training. 
“Other acceptable certification or license” includes certifications and licenses accepted by ACA 
to meet the certification requirements of this standard. For example, persons certified in 
whitewater rescue are deemed to have acceptable certification for those activities that take 
place on whitewater. Check the ACA website, ACAcamps.org, for information on certifying 
bodies. 
“Youth groups” include youth rental groups as well as short-term residential programs provided 
by camp for youth. Rental groups should be advised in contracts or other written instructions of

appropriate certification requirements for aquatic personnel. 
This standard also applies to non-staffed public facilities. In these situations, the camp staff 
accompanying the campers must meet the requirements of this standard. Camps that use 
vendor-provided personnel for watercraft activities score AD.47.

E. Is at least 18 years or older?
Contextual Education 
The intent is that one designated leader on each trip meets both the skill/ experience 
requirements and the age requirement. In choosing this individual, it is important to consider 
many factors including if the camp is in the US or abroad. Knowledge of and sensitivity to other 
cultures is critical for trips outside the US.

ST.17.1 - Are all aquatic activities on extended trip/travel programs guarded and 
supervised by a staff member who has documented skills and training in water rescue 
and emergency procedures specific to the location and the activity, and:
A. For watercraft activities has:
1.Instructor rating in the appropriate craft; or
2.Certification as a lifeguard from a recognized certifying body; or
3.Other acceptable certification or license; and/or
B. For swimming activities has: 
1.Certification as a lifeguard from a recognized certifying body; or 
2.Acceptable certification other than lifeguard as in Part A, and participants are 
wearing personal floatation device (PFDs)?
Contextual Education 
Lifeguards must be positioned in locations where they are able to provide effective surveillance, 
and in close enough proximity to participants to readily respond and execute rescue in an 
incident/emergency. 
“Staff member,” for the purpose of this standard, refers to a camp staff member or a staff person 
of the outfitter or aquatic organization/facility providing the instruction or supervision of the 
activity. If persons other than camp staff are on duty at the activity, the camp must have 
assurances that the qualifications required by this standard are met. Such assurances may be 
in the contract for services, in a letter from the facility manager, advertised personnel 
requirements for guard or guide positions, or local laws or regulations. 
Documented skills must specifically address water rescue skills appropriate for the activity, the 
craft, and the type of aquatic area in use (e.g., whitewater rafting, deep-lake canoeing, open-
water sailing). Because most lifeguard training courses are pool based, camps must be certain 
staff members also have appropriate boating training and rescue skills. Certification courses 
listed may or may not include rescue and emergency training specific to the craft and location; 
therefore, camps may need to provide or arrange for additional training to meet the 
requirements of the standard.
“Other acceptable certification or license” means recognized by an ACA-recognized certifying 
body as appropriate for the specific aquatic activity or area.

Staff and 
Supervision: 
Training
STAFF AND SUPERVISION : Training
The key to any camp’s success is its personnel. One of the unique features of a camp is the vital 
and all-encompassing leadership role demanded of its personnel in the camp community. Camp 
personnel are expected to assume many responsibilities, deliver a wide range of services, and 
complete numerous tasks in an environment of constant close human interaction, all with quality 
results. Some persons may work with the site operation, some with the program, and some with 
both. 
The physical, emotional, and mental well-being of campers is of utmost importance. This can be 
more readily accomplished when a camp has a system that includes clearly identified staff 
qualifications, well-planned staff training, and appropriate supervision of campers and staff. The 
requirements included in the standards vary according to the nature of the positions in question. 
Personnel to be considered in scoring this section of standards include: 
•Volunteer and paid staff involved with the operation of both the site and programming; 
•Volunteer and paid staff who are supervised by the camp operator/director; and
•Volunteer and paid staff for which the camp operator/director has overall responsibility for 
selection, training, supervision, and dismissal. 
Generally, these standards do not apply to consultants (unless otherwise noted in a specific 
standard), workshop leaders, and other personnel who are not part of the camp’s staff. However, 
administrators should consider the requirements of the human resources standards in utilizing 
such persons. 
As with all standards, it is important to read the “Does Not Apply” statement to determine 
applicability for your camp.

ST.18.1 - Does the camp require that any vehicle transporting fifteen (15) or more 
campers carry, in addition to the driver, a camp staff member who has been trained in 
safety responsibilities and group management?
Contextual Education 
The camp should analyze situations that may require additional staff supervision when 
determining transportation supervision ratios. For example, a camp may want to avoid instances 
when a child would be left alone in a vehicle with only one staff member. Examples of safety 
responsibilities related to supervision include managing behavior, accounting for all passengers, 
and ensuring use of restraint devices.

E. Handling camper behavior; 
F. Location of campers during refueling; 
G. Checking the vehicle prior to the occupants’ transportation; and 
H. If buses are used, evacuation procedures?
Contextual Education 
Camp administrators need to verify that drivers possess the skills to appropriately handle the 
vehicles to be driven. The intent of this standard is to go beyond the training required for a 
driver’s license, focusing on the camp’s procedures regarding the items listed for the specific 
vehicle including the camp’s minivan or SUV. Training should be provided behind the wheel and 
through a review of written procedures.

DNA: ST.20.1 and 
ST.20.2 do not apply 
if motorized watercraft 
or personal watercraft 
are never used.
ST.20.1 - Does the camp provide:
All operators and drivers with training prior to the use of motorboats and motorized 
personal watercraft that includes procedures for: 
A. Orientation to federal, state, and local watercraft laws including speed restrictions, 
operator age, and carriage requirements; 
B. Familiarization with common navigation rules and boater courtesy; 
C. Safely loading and unloading of passengers, including downed skiers, if applicable; 
D. Dealing with mechanical failure; and 
E. Refueling?
ST.20.2 - Does the camp provide:
On-the-water training in the specific type of watercraft to be used that includes: 
A. Use of throttle, shift, and steering; and 
B. Securing the craft at pier, dock, or mooring?
Contextual Education 
“Motorized boats” include ski boats, safety boats, motorized personal watercraft, outboards, and 
similar forms of watercraft. 
“Carriage requirements” vary according to state and local regulations, along with the size of the 
vessel. Some requirements may include minimum numbers of PFDs, bells or whistles, visual 
distress signals, and the number of fire extinguishers that must be on board. 
While the level or amount of training has not been specified by the standard, the intent is to 
provide boat-specific training even for individuals with experience operating motorized boats. It 
is particularly important for drivers to be oriented to site-specific speed limits and no-wake 
zones. Common navigation rules can be found at: www.boatus.org/navigation-rules/ 
Training may be provided by camp staff or rental group leaders. Training records are required 
for motorized boats used by the camp; written policies are required for rental groups if the camp 
does not provide supervision.

Written 
Documentation 
Required
ST.21.1 - Are camp staff trained to: 
A. Identify their role and responsibilities related to camp healthcare; 
B. Use healthcare supplies and equipment with which they may be furnished; 
C. Identify those situations that should be attended to only by a designated healthcare 
provider; and 
D. Use established sanitary procedures when dealing with infectious waste or body 
fluids?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is to help assure that all camp staff members receive training about 
their roles for the identified situation and circumstances. Staff members require training to 
identify the limits and expectations of their participation in the delivery of healthcare, including 
first aid, in camp. 
Roles and responsibilities of staff members will vary from camp to camp, but preventative roles 
may include watching for and planning to avoid illness, fatigue, dehydration, sunburn, ticks, and 
more. First-aid training should equip staff members to deal with reasonably anticipated 
healthcare concerns based on the clientele, location and activities. This could range from simple 
first-aid procedures to handling choking and seizures. Staff members may also require training 
in care for orthodontic, orthopedic, and prosthetic devices; persons in wheelchairs; individuals 
with bedwetting or homesickness, or those with mental, emotional, and social health concerns 
such as anxiety. 
Regarding ST.21.1 D of the standard, “infectious waste” includes syringes, needles, or 
dressings wet with body fluids or blood. The use of barriers (e.g., CPR barriers, masks, or 
gloves), handwashing, sanitizing procedures, and appropriate waste disposal must be 
considered when developing procedures in this area. Camps with staff or campers requiring 
injections will need sharps containers for needle disposal. Biohazard bags (“red bags”) are 
required by OSHA for dressings or materials used to soak up blood, bodily fluids, or other 
potentially infectious waste. State departments of health can give guidance on appropriate 
handling and disposal procedures. 
Universal precautions for bloodborne pathogens as established by OSHA are applicable to all 
camps.

Written 
Documentation 
Required
ST.25.1 - Before assuming job responsibilities, are all camp staff directly involved in 
camp programming and camper supervision provided training by the camp that includes 
at least the following topics: 
A. Camp purpose, focus, mission, intended outcomes, and how these are implemented in 
camp structure and program activities; 
B. Developmental needs of campers to be served and the resulting differences necessary 
for program and structure; 
C. Objectives, safety considerations, skills progression, operating procedures, and 
competencies required for program activities; 
D. Age-appropriate behavior management and camper supervision techniques to help 
create a physically and emotionally safe environment; 
E. Clear expectations for staff performance and conduct, including sexual harassment 
policies; 
F. Recognition, prevention, and reporting of child abuse; and 
G. Emergency procedures and staff members’ roles in implementation?
Contextual Education 
Covering all the topics listed, along with the other training needs of camps, will generally require 
at least two to three (2 to 3) days for short-term day camps, and five to six (5 to 6) days for 
resident camps. 
Regarding Part F, the training related to “recognition, prevention, and reporting of child abuse” 
should include information on the identification and prevention of all types of abuse—physical, 
sexual, emotional, and verbal. It should also cover abuse in all situations—camper to camper, 
camp staff to camper, and other adult to camper—as well as abuse taking place both outside 
and within the camp setting. Staff should receive training in the state’s child abuse laws 
including definitions of abusive behavior, reporting requirements, and penalties. Practices 
concerning staff-to-staff abuse should be addressed in the camp’s personnel policies. 
Because staff training is so critical to running a safe and effective program for campers, 
procedures should ensure that late hires and replacement staff are trained in all the areas 
typically addressed during precamp training. For example, the camp might arrange for late hires 
to receive training through individual training sessions with the staff person’s supervisor, 
orientation sessions with activity specialists, periods of “apprenticeship” under fully trained staff, 
or self-study of relevant topics.

clear expectations for acceptable job performance?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is that each person assuming job responsibilities, regardless of the 
time of year, be provided training in the camp’s expectations of his or her specific 
responsibilities. Job training should include specific job skills, reporting and supervisory 
relationships, and acceptable and unacceptable behaviors for staff members. In addition, staff 
may require training in the use of equipment, safety and emergency procedures including those 
associated with responding to mental, emotional, and social health needs; identifying and 
managing environmental and other hazards; handling accidents; or providing services to rental 
groups or campers. 
To achieve an acceptable level of job performance and behavior, staff members must also be 
provided with a clear understanding of what is expected of them by camp administrators and 
supervisors.

ST.27.1 - Have all supervisors been provided written guidelines and specific training to 
help them: 
A. Monitor the performance of staff members they supervise; 
B. Identify and reinforce or correct staff behavior, as appropriate; and 
C. Carry out their responsibilities in the camp’s performance review system?
Contextual Education 
To effectively observe and evaluate, supervisors need to be able to identify the acceptable 
levels of job performance and appropriate behaviors of the staff positions they supervise. 
Acceptable job performance and appropriate behavior include, for example, acting as a positive 
role model for campers, enforcing safety rules, utilizing appropriate teaching techniques, 
encouraging positive interactions among campers, and settling disputes. Training for 
supervisors should include how and when to observe staff, what to look for, and how to 
communicate suggestions for improvement. 
Supervisors should also develop skills in identifying and addressing inappropriate staff behavior 
with campers and/or with other staff. 
Supervisors need to receive specific training on ways to evaluate staff member’s performance. 
Depending on the camp, the performance review system may range from verbal

ST.28.1 - Has the camp established written procedures and trained staff members to 
supervise campers in various types of general and unstructured camp activities?
Contextual Education 
The training addressed in this standard should cover the responsibilities of any staff person on 
duty with campers during the general and unstructured activities of the camp day. These 
activities include everything that is not considered a specialized program in which designated 
and trained program staff members are responsible for campers. Unstructured camp activities 
include cabin time, night time, free time, playground, meal time, transitional periods, canteen, 
and personal hygiene periods (e.g., showers). 
Supervision procedures and training should cover how to delineate roles when several staff 
members are present; what to look or listen for that may require action; intervention techniques; 
how and where to get additional help; location while on duty; and monitoring responsibilities 
specific to the activities, areas, and participants. 
If camp staff personnel share supervision responsibilities with rental group leaders, procedures 
and training should clarify expectations for and responsibilities of both the camp staff and rental 
group leaders. Additional responsibilities specific to program specialists or program activities are 
noted in the program-related standards.

ST.29.1 - Has the camp established written procedures and trained staff members in 
areas relevant to creating a safe environment and expected to: 
A. Speak with and listen to all campers respectfully; 
B. Focus attention primarily on the campers; and 
C. Promote mental, emotional, social, and physical health and safety?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is to ensure that staff members are trained in techniques to promote 
a safe physical and emotional environment and positive staff–camper interactions. For example, 
staff should be trained to: 
•Show respect for campers by calling them by their names or preferred nicknames; 
•Use language easily understood by campers; 
•Provide explanations for actions taken; 
•Speak with campers at eye level; 
•Use techniques that do not intentionally embarrass or ridicule campers or groups of 
people; 
•Meet the mental, emotional, and social health needs of campers; 
•Be sensitive to behaviors that indicate stress, and act on at-risk observations; 
•Discourage and correct behaviors that include teasing, disrespectful behavior, belittling, 
or intimidation; and 
•Carry out camp activities in different ways depending on the developmental level of the 
campers.

ST.30.1 - Has the camp established written procedures and trained staff members in 
behavior management procedures that include techniques to: 
A. Teach problem-solving skills that achieve positive outcomes; 
B. Recognize and address bullying; and 
C. Implement fair and consistent disciplinary steps appropriate to the camper and 
situation?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is to create an environment in which the campers are involved—in 
developmentally appropriate ways—in setting expectations and rules for how people should 
treat one another at camp. Training should enable staff members to develop competencies to 
guide group behavior to establish positive norms and employ appropriate problem-solving 
approaches. 
Written procedures should identify the general philosophy and approach to discipline when it is 
necessary, including any progressive steps that may be implemented in disciplining a camper 
as well as identifying inappropriate techniques. Policies and procedures should emphasize the 
consistent and fair enforcement of rules.

Contextual Education 
Staff members should be able to recognize inappropriate conversation and behavior, and know 
how to respond. This might include a statement such as, “this is a discussion you should have 
at home” or “that’s not a topic for camp.” “Socially sensitive conversations and behaviors” may 
include topics such as smoking, drugs, tattoos, body piercing, sexuality, dating, cults, religion, 
ghost or horror stories, divorce, and personal lives of staff members.

C. Handle potential emergency situations?
Contextual Education 
“Training” may come from experience in leading similar programs, sessions conducted during 
staff orientation, or leadership development programs designed to train or certify trip or travel 
leaders. Because trip leaders do not have access to health center support services, thorough 
training is critical. 
While it is always important to know how to handle emergencies, when traveling abroad this 
task may require additional work or study prior to travel to be prepared to handle an unexpected 
event.

STAFF AND SUPERVISION: Skill Verification and Observation
The key to any camp’s success is its personnel. One of the unique features of a camp is the vital 
and all-encompassing leadership role demanded of its personnel in the camp community. Camp 
personnel are expected to assume many responsibilities, deliver a wide range of services, and 
complete numerous tasks in an environment of constant close human interaction, all with quality 
results. Some persons may work with the site operation, some with the program, and some with 
both. 
The physical, emotional, and mental well-being of campers is of utmost importance. This can be 
more readily accomplished when a camp has a system that includes clearly identified staff 
qualifications, well-planned staff training, and appropriate supervision of campers and staff. The 
requirements included in the standards vary according to the nature of the positions in question. 
Personnel to be considered in scoring this section of standards include: 
•Volunteer and paid staff involved with the operation of both the site and programming; 
•Volunteer and paid staff who are supervised by the camp operator/director; and
•Volunteer and paid staff for which the camp operator/director has overall responsibility for 
selection, training, supervision, and dismissal. 
Generally, these standards do not apply to consultants (unless otherwise noted in a specific 
standard), workshop leaders, and other personnel who are not part of the camp’s staff. However, 
administrators should consider the requirements of the human resources standards in utilizing 
such persons. 
As with all standards, it is important to read the “Does Not Apply” statement to determine 
applicability for your camp.

ST.34.1 - Does the camp have a system of regular observations of staff members to 
provide support and ensure acceptable job performance criteria are continually 
practiced, and when applicable, observation and evaluation includes program areas 
(specialized activities, aquatics, trip staff)?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is to ensure that observations of staff occur on a regular, systematic 
basis. The camp should establish guidelines that include specifications for how often 
observations should occur. However, the standard does not require that all staff members 
receive the same levels of supervision— staff with different backgrounds and skill levels may 
require different levels of supervision. Accordingly, the camp’s guidelines should provide for 
observation levels that are appropriate to a staff member’s skills, experience, requests for help, 
and previous evaluations. The frequency of observations may also vary based on factors such 
as the complexity of the program and length of the camp season, but an initial observation 
should occur early in the camp season with any corrective action requested be implemented 
immediately. 
For program staff specifically, the intent of this standard includes that supervisors document 
observations of leaders conducting program activities with participants. Areas to evaluate 
include the staff enforcing established safety regulations; providing age- and ability-appropriate 
instruction to participants; and that staff members can identify and manage environmental and 
other hazards related to an activity. Documentation may include checklists, copies of 
performance evaluations, or notes taken by supervisors.

Contextual Education 
“General camp activities” are those that do not require special technical skills, equipment, or 
safety regulations other than those that generally apply throughout the camp. Examples include 
singing, nature studies, religious instruction, and crafts. Ratios and qualifications for supervision 
of specific program activities are covered in the standards dealing with those specific areas. 
The camp should implement established supervision ratio policies for its own programs and 
advise leaders of rental groups about appropriate supervision ratios and policies. Appropriate 
supervision is one key to camper safety and program quality. Camps should evaluate their 
policies on a regular basis. To meet the appropriate ratios, a combination of camp staff and 
adult leaders for rental groups is acceptable. 
Specific to ST.35.1, “staff” includes those individuals with the responsibility, authority, and 
training to provide direct supervision to camper groups. This may include counselors, general 
activity leaders, or other staff members who may provide supervision to campers without 
assistance. Junior counselors may be included in meeting the ratios in ST.35.1 only if they are 
considered staff and have received training and supervision to verify their ability to handle 
camper groups independently. “Staff” does not include campers in leadership training or 
counselors in training programs (often called CITs or LITs), other “counselor support personnel” 
(see glossary), or staff who have exclusive administrative, office, food service or maintenance 
duties. 
In ST.35.2, any exceptions to the general ratios should be in accordance with the type of 
activity, the area, and characteristics of the participants. Camp policies may specify no 
exceptions. Exceptions for times such as free time, rest hour, after lights out, early morning, 
field trips, and overnights must be well-defined and justified; statistics indicate that these are the 
times when accidents and incidents are most likely to occur in camps. 
In ST.35.3, camps must consciously determine when at least two (2) staff members are 
required to be present with camper groups, both for the sake of safety and to prevent situations 
that may increase the opportunity for child abuse. Examples of relevant activities and situations 
include overnights, trips, and showers. 
When the camp serves campers with special physical, medical, cognitive, or behavioral needs 
who require additional staff support to participate in camp (e.g., physically or mentally disabled, 
developmentally delayed, emotionally disturbed), the following ratios of staff and counselor-
support personnel to campers are suggested: 
Camper Description                                                             Staff    Campers  
Needing constant and individual assistance or supervision     1             1  
Needing close but not constant assistance or supervision       1             2  
Needing occasional assistance                                                1             4  
Needing minimal assistance                                                     1            5  
Age ratios apply to programs staffed by the camp as well as to the instructions given to rental 
groups for supervision of youth.

Advise rental groups to provide training to all staff members to minimize the potential of 
any rental group staffer being in a one-on-one camper–personnel situation when out of

Contextual Education 
Appropriate supervision and interaction between campers and staff (to include counselors, 
support staff, and administrative staff) are key to camper–staff safety. Policies and staff training 
should be provided to all camp staff to make them aware of the need to avoid situations in 
which they may find themselves in a one-on-one situation with a camper when out of sight of 
others. Consideration should be given to: 
•Restroom and shower protocols 
•The healthcare setting 
•Special needs campers who may need personal care assistance 
•The desire or need for staff–camper one-on-one conversations 
•Program design 
Methods to consider include operating under the “rule of three’” being in auditory or visual range 
of others when a situation requires one-on-one interaction; and providing settings that are in 
sight of others but not in the “middle of it all.”

Contextual Education 
When campers are at facilities off site for activities provided by the camp or vendors, and/or 
participating with vendor-provided programs who bring instructors, equipment, or animals (e.g., 
horses) to the camp, staff members must be aware of their supervisory responsibilities. 
Procedures must be written. Staff training should clarify responsibilities including location of

The camp should analyze situations that may require additional staff supervision when 
determining transportation ratios. For example, a camp may want to avoid instances in which a 
child would be left alone in a vehicle with only one staff member. Examples of safety 
responsibilities related to supervision include managing behavior, accounting for all passengers, 
and ensuring use of restraint devices.

ST.42.2 - Does the camp specify and maintain and/or advise rental groups to specify and 
maintain: 
A minimum of two (2) trained staff members are present at all times, at least one of whom 
is an adult?
Contextual Education 
Ratios for each activity should be established in accordance with the type of activity, the area, 
and the characteristics of participants. Camps may seek the recommendations of authoritative 
sources. When rental groups provide their own aquatics personnel, they must be advised of the 
camp’s aquatic supervision and ratio requirements. 
In ST.42.2, the intent is to ensure that at least two (2) trained individuals are available at all 
times, and at least one (1) staff member is eighteen (18) years old or older. In many situations, 
only one person needs certification if the second individual has been trained to carry out 
secondary duties (e.g., maintaining surveillance, clearing the area, contacting additional help) in 
the event of an emergency. “Staff members” in this standard may be from the camp,r ental 
group or vendor.  If vendor-provided personnel are used, ratios may be a combination of those 
established by the public facility, contracted service or vendor, and those specified by the camp.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND ACTIVITIES 
Program is the heart of camp—where camp philosophy and objectives are implemented in a 
sustained experience that provides a creative, recreational, and educational opportunity in group 
living, often in the outdoors. Camp programming uses trained leadership and often the resources 
of the natural surroundings to contribute to each camper’s mental, physical, social, and spiritual 
growth. 
The camp provides program activities as a means of achieving its developmental goals and 
outcomes, conducted in ways that protect the health, safety, and well-being of its campers. 
Program standards allow the flexibility for each camp to take advantage of its own unique 
programming strengths and determine its own procedures while still addressing areas of 
program planning, analysis, and delivery. 
Defining specific standards for all potential and unique program activities is impossible and 
impractical. However, three basic concepts need to be at the core of any activity offered in camp. 
The program standards require the camp administration to address the following important 
considerations: 
1.Qualified supervision of the activity, 
2.Sound guidelines, safety regulations, and emergency procedures for conduct of the 
activity, and 
3.Provision and maintenance of acceptable facilities and equipment. 
The standards included in this section address both general program activities and specialized 
program activities, including horseback riding, challenge/ adventure programs, and trips of any 
length.
PROGRAM: Specialized Program Activities
Guidelines to determine if an activity should be considered a specialized program: 
•Activities that use equipment, animals, or tools whose use by campers requires 
supervision by a person skilled in their use (such as horseback riding, 
adventure/challenge activities, archery, bicycles, all-terrain vehicles [ATVs], go-karts, 
gymnastics, power tools, model rocketry, lacrosse, or shooting sports); and specific sport-
related programs (such as soccer camp, baseball camp); 
•Activities that involve camper use of fire (such as fire building for cookouts), or camper 
use of heat-producing equipment or substances (such as woodburning tools or kilns); 
•Activities that require injury-protection equipment, such as helmets, goggles, or padding 
(used for example in wrestling or fencing, competitive baseball, competitive soccer, 
paintball); and 
•Activities that require a specialized skill set or knowledge, such as edible plants, ice 
fishing, pyrotechnics, and circus stunts that occur in the air (trapeze, tightrope, etc.). 
If any of the preceding guidelines fit, the activity/program should be considered a specialized 
activity/program and scored accordingly.

PD.1.1 - Does the camp offer program activities that implement camp goals and 
outcomes and provide campers the opportunity to experience progression, challenge, 
and success?
Contextual Education 
The intent is that each camper experience activities that provide the opportunity for progression, 
challenge, and success. This may include a natural progression that comes with practice and 
guidance such as swimming, horseback riding, canoeing, or archery. It may also include 
activities made available as campers reach minimum age levels or abilities. Examples of this 
may include, “the twelve-year-olds get to go on an overnight trip” or “if you succeed on the 
climbing wall, then next time you can climb the rock face.”

DNA: PD.2.3 does not 
apply if no equipment 
for specialized

PD.2.1 - Does the camp have written procedures for all program equipment that include: 
A. Equipment is checked on a regular basis for safety, maintained in good repair, and 
stored in a manner to safeguard effectiveness; and 
B. Equipment is removed from service if not in good repair?
PD.2.2 - For all specialized activities and equipment used for any trip, does the camp 
have written procedures for all program equipment that include: 
A. Equipment is appropriate to the size and ability of the user; and 
B. Equipment has a safety check prior to each use?
PD.2.3 - For all adventure/challenge course equipment, does the camp have written 
procedures that include maintaining written records of regular inspection and 
maintenance of all adventure/ challenge elements and equipment?
Contextual Education 
“Equipment” includes all equipment used to carry out both general and specialized program 
activities such as archery, sports, outdoor living skills, crafts, backpacking, adventure/challenge 
activities, horseback riding, or other specialized program activities. For example, if the camp 
offers adventure/challenge activities, equipment may include apparel (e.g., helmets, gloves), 
harnesses, ropes, light sources for spelunking and other gear. Similarly, if the camp offers 
horseback riding, equipment may include saddles, bridles, girths, ropes-related equipment. This 
standard applies to equipment provided by the camp and/or participants (such as backpacks on 
trips). 
Camp staff should follow specific guidelines from authoritative sources on what to look for in 
conducting safety checks prior to each use. “Elements” in PD.2.5 are relevant in the context of 
adventure/challenge activities and refer to stations or events in ropes courses and challenge 
courses, to climbing walls, rappelling towers, zip lines, Tarzan swings, and related elements. 
In the context of horseback riding, equipment (including saddles, bridles, girths, and ropes) 
should be checked carefully for excessive wear or deterioration. The equipment check should 
assure an adequate supply of appropriately sized equipment for participants.
Authoritative source guidelines should also be followed regarding documentation needed for 
inspections, use, maintenance, and replacement. Maintenance records for equipment include 
hours of use and falls on climbing and belay ropes; inspection records for harnesses, 
carabiners, helmets, and webbing; and purchase, cleaning, and replacement dates for 
equipment. For trip equipment, checks should be specific to the equipment used: water filters, 
stoves, tents, etc.

any length. 
Procedures and training for PD.3.1 should specify steps for proper camp stove use and any 
restrictions on participant use of stoves or flammable fuels. 
The intent of PD.3.2 is to address questionable water supplies, not those that have been tested 
by public authorities for residential or public use. Water from natural bodies of water or springs 
should be treated if there is no assurance that the supply has been approved by local authorities 
for human consumption. The camp should use appropriate water purification methods based on 
advice from local authorities to identify possible contaminants for that area or specific water 
supply.

C. Clearly defined shooting line(s)?
PD.8.2 - Does the camp require these safety elements for all archery activities:
Clear safety signals and range commands to control activity at the firing line and during 
the retrieval of arrows?
PD.8.3 - Does the camp require these safety elements for all archery activities:
When not in use, bows and arrows are stored in a locked cabinet or closet, not 
accessible except to staff members?
Contextual Education 
Establishing safety buffers and zones around the archery range is critical to safe operation of 
the activity. Everyone who may be close to the area for any reason must be aware of and 
oriented to the safety zones and boundaries. Camps may use posted signs or warnings, 
physical barriers, or specific scheduling procedures to control access. 
“Safety signals and range commands” are the specific commands and instructions used to 
assure the orderly and safe operation of the range. Participants must learn and follow 
commands to demonstrate respect for the potential danger involved with the unsafe use of 
archery equipment. 
The locked “cabinet or closet” can be at the range or in a different building. Preventing 
unauthorized access is important.

smaller than 90cc and steps have been taken to control the speed capability of these 
vehicles; 
B. No passengers are allowed; and 
C. ATVs are not operated on paved or public roads?
Contextual Education 
Camps who use ATVs for programming (in camp, provided by a vendor, or at a public facility) 
should be familiar with safety studies and follow recommendations of manufacturers and safety 
groups such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Restrictions in size and 
power are required because young campers generally do not have the physical size and 
coordination to operate such vehicles safely, according to manufacturers. In addition, young 
campers may not have the experience and judgment necessary to operate a motorized vehicle.

Contextual Education 
Helmets should be appropriately sized and designed for the specific activity, as helmet 
construction standards vary with different activities. This standard requires the use of helmets 
approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or UIAA. A helmet should 
fit the user comfortably, not obscure the user’s vision, and be secured with a chin strap. 
Helmets may be supplied by the camp or by a staffed public facility, vendor, or may be the 
personal property of the camper or staff. 
In PD.12.2: “Motorized vehicles” include motorcycles, motor bikes, go-karts, and ATVs. 
In PD.12.3: An “active participant” is defined as: 
•In spelunking, anyone participating in the activity, 
•In any kind of climbing or high-ropes activity (including a zip line), the person climbing. 
Camps are encouraged to define in their policy any additional situations in which other 
participants should wear helmets (e.g., belayers on natural rock walls, persons in the “drop 
zone,” persons waiting on real rock walls) either for safety or to model good practice. 
In PD.12.4: The term “boarding” refers only to boarding activities that take place on 
land—skateboarding, snowboarding, or mountain boarding. It does not refer to wakeboarding.

fit the user comfortably, not obscure the user’s vision, and be secured with a chin strap. 
Helmets may be supplied by the camp or by a staffed public facility, vendor, or may be the 
personal property of the camper or staff. 
In PD.12.2: “Motorized vehicles” include motorcycles, motor bikes, go-karts, and ATVs. 
In PD.12.3: An “active participant” is defined as: 
•In spelunking, anyone participating in the activity, 
•In any kind of climbing or high-ropes activity (including a zip line), the person climbing. 
Camps are encouraged to define in their policy any additional situations in which other 
participants should wear helmets (e.g., belayers on natural rock walls, persons in the “drop 
zone,” persons waiting on real rock walls) either for safety or to model good practice. 
In PD.12.4: The term “boarding” refers only to boarding activities that take place on 
land—skateboarding, snowboarding, or mountain boarding. It does not refer to wakeboarding. 
“Skating” includes any kind of activity on wheeled skates, such as roller blading and in-line 
skating. It does not include roller skating in an indoor rink or contained, smooth surface outdoor 
rink or ice skating. “Hockey” includes both roller hockey and ice hockey, but does not include 
field hockey or floor hockey.

or vendor. 
DNA: PD.15.1 and 
PD.15.2 do not apply 
to vaulting activities 
on a lunge line.
PD.15.1 - During horseback riding activities, including pony rides:
Does the camp require camp staff members and campers under the age of 18 to wear a 
helmet?
PD.15.2 - During horseback riding activities, including pony rides: 
For campers and staff over the age of 18, does the camp require an individual to either 
wear a helmet or complete an acknowledgement of risk form (legal in the state in which 
the camp is located) if they choose not to wear a helmet. This document must:
A. Inform the participant of the advantages of equestrian helmet use; 
B. Inform the participant of the risks associated with the choice not to wear a helmet; 
C. State the participant is making an informed and voluntary decision; 
D. Address any other facility, regulatory, legal, or liability issues; and 
E. Include any language as required under state equine activity liability laws?
Contextual Education 
Helmets should be appropriately sized and designed specifically for the identified activity, as 
helmet construction standards vary with different activities. This standard requires the use of 
helmets approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-approved). A 
helmet should fit the rider comfortably, not obscure the rider’s vision, and be secured with a chin 
strap. Helmets may be supplied by the camp or by a staffed public facility or vendor, or a helmet 
may be the personal property of the camper or staff member. Any helmet used must be specific 
to the activity and be ASTM approved. Should a camp make the decision to allow riders over 
the age of 18 to NOT wear a helmet, staff should be reminded of the role-modeling staff have 
for campers. 
Camps should be aware that the acknowledgment of risk is a legal document. Camps must 
understand the potential differences in the documentation an employee might sign (e.g., release 
or waiver). It is recommended that camps seek knowledgeable legal counsel in preparing this 
document. 
Related to horseback riding, “vaulting” is an activity in which campers perform a combination of 
gymnastics and dance routines on a moving horse. See www. americanvaultingassociation.org.

DNA: PD.16.1 and 
PD.16.2 do not apply 
if pony rides are never 
provided by camp or 
vendor.
PD.16.1 - Does the camp have procedures in practice for the conduct of “pony” rides that 
include: 
The use of sound horses or ponies?
PD.16.2 - Does the camp have procedures in practice for the conduct of “pony” rides that 
include: 
Provision of an adequate number of qualified individuals assisting with mounting and 
dismounting, leading the horse or pony, and assisting riders as necessary?
Contextual Education 
Related to these standards, “pony” rides are activities in which the horse or pony is led at a walk 
by a trained individual other than the rider, or the animal is controlled by a mechanical device 
that leads it at a walk. At no time is the rider expected to have control or allowed unassisted 
control of the horse or pony, and the rider is usually lifted on and off the animal or mounts from 
a mounting platform. 
In PD.16.2, “qualified” means individuals who have been trained specifically to handle and 
control horses, to assess the level of care and assistance needed for riders, and to respond 
appropriately to rescue or emergency situations. The number of staff members or assistants 
required will depend on the activities, riding area, and clientele. For riders with special needs, 
specific therapeutic riding training should be required for staff.

never located on 
camp property.
PD.17.1 - Are stables, corrals, paddocks, riding rings, and other livestock areas: 
Located away from living areas?
PD.17.2 - Are stables, corrals, paddocks, riding rings, and other livestock areas:
Clean, free from accumulation of manure, and provided with a plentiful supply of fresh 
water?
Contextual Education 
In PD.17.1, “away from” means that living areas (other than those for persons caring for horses) 
are located far enough away from livestock to avoid increased numbers of flies, insects, undue 
odor, or increased dust and dirt. 
In PD.17.2, water should be readily available but not create a safety hazard that may be caused 
by having tubs of water inside a riding ring or enclosure. 
PD.17.1 and PD.17.2 are to be scored when horses and/or livestock are temporarily brought on 
site for programming purposes (e.g., horses are brought on site to conduct horseback riding 
activities and leave at the end of the activity).

PD.18.1 - Are all horse and livestock medications: 
A. Handled only by individuals trained or experienced in their safe use; and 
B. Secured in an area away from camper access and locked when not in use?
Contextual Education 
Medications used for horses, ponies, and other livestock are very potent due to the size of the 
animals for which they are developed. They may be flavored or scented so animals are more 
receptive to their use. To avoid accidental ingestion, campers should not have access to these 
items. 
Fly spray or wipes, commonly used for horses, can be a concentrated insecticide. Although fly 
spray and wipes are not required to be kept under locked control, all users should be trained in 
appropriate use.

Program: 
Aquatic 
Activities
PROGRAM AQUATICS 
Many camps offer aquatic activities as a major program element for campers. Swimming and 
boating activities take place in and on pools, ponds, lakes, rivers, ocean fronts, and creeks. 
Safety is a central concern in all aquatic activities, and the purpose of the aquatic standards is to 
set an expectation for trained and certified supervision (scored in the Staff and Supervision 
Section), appropriate safety precautions, and well-planned emergency procedures. 
The aquatic standards are to be applied to all instructional and recreational aquatic activities 
including but not limited to: swimming, boating, waterskiing, sailboarding, stand-up paddle 
boarding, SCUBA diving, rafting, waterpark activities, tubing, diving, and synchronized 
swimming. 
The aquatic standards may not be applicable to all activities conducted near bodies of water or 
in shallow water if the water depth or conditions are such that a person in the water (intentionally 
or unintentionally) could be helped by someone trained in elementary, nonswimming forms of 
rescue. However, if lifeguarding precautions may be required due to water depth or conditions 
(such as current or temperature), the aquatic standards apply. For example, fishing activities that 
take place on the banks of a deep/swiftly flowing river or creek may require a guard. Likewise, 
fishing activities at the edge of a gently sloping, shallow pond may be supervised by noncertified 
personnel with appropriate training. 
Aquatic activities occurring as part of trip or extended trip/travel programs (three nights or more) 
are also scored in this section. 
Use of commercial vessels operated by licensed personnel, such as ferries and fishing boats for 
hire, need not be scored under the aquatic standards. However, even when the aquatics 
standards are not scored, administrators should consider the requirements of the standards 
when selecting vendors, activities, and locations.
If camp only uses vendor-provided personnel for all aquatic activities, only score PA.9 and for 
watercraft activities, PA.12 through PA.14 and PA.16. Camps must also score AD.46 and/or 
AD.47.
APPLICABILITY: PA.1 to PA.10 are scored for all Aquatic Activities
APPLICABILITY: PA.11 to 16 are scored for Watercraft Activities. This include all use of small 
craft (e.g., canoes, sailboats, rowboats, kayaks, rafts, paddleboards, personal watercraft, 
motorboats, and fishing boats). It also includes boardsailing, tubing, waterskiing, rafting, and so 
on. Bumper boats are not included in aquatic or watercraft activities and should be scored as a 
specialized activity.

Contextual Education 
Regulations should be specific to the aquatic area and activity and may include regulations 
established to meet other standards such as minimum ratios, safety systems, lookout 
responsibilities, evaluation and classification of participants, and use of personal flotation 
devices (PFDs). Regulations may also include weather restrictions, pool rules, watercraft 
regulations, navigation rules, diving restrictions, safety signals or commands, warning systems, 
behavior rules, and non-swimmer restrictions. Use of water recreation equipment such as 
inflatable, floating trampolines, and towable sleds may require specific safety regulations.

2.Emergency and rescue equipment available; and 
3.Location of the nearest phone (and where the physical address and phone 
numbers of the location are posted, so the caller can identify location to 
emergency services)? 
Contextual Education 
Procedures and rehearsals should be specific to each aquatic area and the activities conducted 
there. “Features and hazards” of aquatic areas include currents, submerged rocks, shallow 
areas, and boundaries of swimming and watercraft areas. 
When rental groups provide their own aquatics personnel, camps must have a procedure for 
informing those responsible for the safety of rental groups about the safety procedures and 
equipment available to them.

PA.4.1 - To protect campers and staff with mobility impairments around bodies of water, 
does the camp implement safety practices identifying: 
A. A means of preventing accidental access to the water, and 
B. Occasions when support equipment or mobility devices should be removed or not 
used—especially from individuals using a wheelchair (this may include straps, seatbelts, 
trays, or other devices that safely secure the person in the chair)?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is for the camp to design and implement precautions to protect the 
safety of all participants, regardless of mobility needs and level of independence. Impaired 
mobility may be permanent or temporary such as a sprained ankle, injured knee, or other 
related conditions. 
Occasions when support equipment is removed from individuals using a wheelchair may include 
when they are riding in a small craft, or when the possibility exists for them to accidentally enter 
the water. “Preventing accidental access to the water” may be accomplished by a physical 
barrier around the pool, on the dock, or adjacent to a natural body of water. It may also be 
accomplished through special staff supervision or other appropriate means. 
Safety practices must be designed for the specific types of mobility impairment of the campers 
served. This information should be included as part of the safety regulations (see standard 
PA.2) and given to rental groups.

PA.5.1 - Does the camp require a system to quickly account for all participants used at all 
aquatic activities and if applicable, the camp advises rental groups who provide their 
own supervision for aquatic activities to use some system?
Contextual Education 
The “buddy system” is a common example of a tracking or safety system for swimmers. Other 
systems may be employed to meet this standard. Tag boards and equipment checkout systems 
may be more appropriate for boating or other aquatic activities. 
When rental groups provide their own supervision for aquatic activities, they must be advised to 
use safety systems and be informed about any equipment available (such as a buddy board) to 
support the camp’s established system.

PA.6.1 - Does the camp: 
A. Evaluate and classify participants’ swimming abilities; and 
B. Assign participants to areas, equipment, facilities, and activities commensurate with 
their abilities?
Contextual Education 
A swim test is not necessarily implied for all activities. Participants may be interviewed and 
placed in appropriate activities or areas until actual skills are demonstrated. For example, for 
short-term recreational swims, procedures may specify that participants remain in shallow water 
until they demonstrate their ability to swim a certain distance before they are allowed in deeper 
water. When rental groups provide their own aquatics personnel, they must be advised of camp 
requirements for evaluation and use of equipment. 
Even if assignment to an activity presumes a beginner or nonskilled level for everyone, 
individuals should still be evaluated to identify any fears or conditions that could affect their 
safety.

DNA: PA.7.1 does not 
apply if camp only 
uses vendor-provided 
personnel for aquatic 
activities.
PA.7.1 - Do camp swimming pool(s) have: 
A. Access to a pool controlled by a fence or other physical barrier; 
B. Water depths clearly marked; C. Routine maintenance procedures to address 
sanitation and safety concerns; 
D. Pool rules posted in a visible location; and 
E. Rescue equipment appropriate for site readily available and in good repair?
Contextual Education 
The marking of water depths should comply with local and state guidelines and requirements. 
“Sanitation and safety concerns” include the use of appropriate chemical storage; presence of 
covered drains, nonskid decks, ladders and diving boards in good repair, and clear water; and 
absence of dirt, debris, and algae. Some states require a certified pool operator to manage 
pools. 
“Pool rules” should be posted in legible print and may include items such as “walk on pool 
deck,” “dive only in designated areas,” “swim with a buddy,” and “obey lifeguards.” 
“Rescue equipment” should include, at least: reaching devices, rescue tubes, and a backboard 
that meets minimum specifications established by rescue and training organizations.

•Camps serving 
rental groups
Written 
Documentation 
Required
DNA: PA.8.1 does not 
apply if camp does 
not have a natural 
body of water used 
for aquatic activities.
DNA: PA.8.1 does not 
apply if camp only 
uses vendor-provided 
personnel for aquatic 
activities.
PA.8.1 - Do natural bodies of water used for aquatic activities have: 
A. Access controlled to docks, watercraft, and equipment; 
B. Rules for use of areas and equipment posted in a visible location; 
C. Known hazards eliminated or activities near them controlled; 
D. Facility equipment regularly checked and maintained; 
E. Separate areas designated for different types of aquatic activities; and 
F. Rescue equipment readily available and in good repair?
Contextual Education 
Controlling access to bodies of water does not necessarily imply physical barriers but may also 
include methods such as education and posting listed regulations. Access to watercraft and 
equipment may be more easily controlled with locks and barriers. 
“Natural body of water” includes lakes, ponds (natural and man-made), and streams, rivers, and 
the ocean. 
“Hazards” in bodies of water at camp, such as drop-offs, currents, and submerged objects, 
should be eliminated when possible or clearly designated with warnings. 
“Facility equipment” includes docks, ladders, secured rafts, diving boards, and related 
equipment. A system for safety checks and regular maintenance should be in place for camp 
equipment. 
“Areas for separate activities” (e.g., boating, swimming, waterskiing, fishing) may be designated 
by physical markers or by education, regulations, or scheduling. Swimming areas should have a 
clearly defined shallow area(s) for non-swimmers and defined areas for diving (if permitted). 
Swimming areas for non-swimmers may be defined by ropes, buoys, booms, or deck markings; 
diving areas may be marked, posted, or designated in regulations. 
“Rescue equipment” should include items such as backboards, rescue tubes, reaching devices, 
or designated rescue crafts as appropriate to the activity.

PA.9 - AQUATIC SITES
Applies to: 
•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
•Short-term 
camps
•Camps serving 
rental groups
Written 
Documentation 
Required 
DNA: PA.9.1 does not 
apply if camp never 
uses aquatic sites 
away from camp 
and/or never uses 
vendor-provided or 
public facilities.
PA.9.1 - Does the camp have written policies or procedures that require these conditions 
to be met when using pools, waterparks, or natural bodies of water located away from 
camp and/or provided by a vendor or public facility (in camp or away from camp): 
A. Campers and staff members are oriented to rules and boundaries; 
B. Trained staff assess water and weather conditions to identify hazards and determine 
appropriate activities; 
C. Camper access is limited, as appropriate; 
D. Facility and equipment appear to be in good repair; and
E. Rescue equipment is readily available and in good repair?
Contextual Education 
Camp staff members may be responsible for instruction or guarding aquatic activities at pools, 
beaches, lakes, and rivers; or public facility personnel may be in charge of guarding or 
instruction with camp staff members responsible for general camper supervision according to 
written policies and procedures established by the camp. Rules, boundaries, schedules, 
responsibilities, and communication should be reviewed with all individuals prior to 
participation. 
(cont.) 
Trained staff members may be from the camp or from the public facility or contracted service. If 
camp staff personnel are lifeguarding, they must meet ST.12, Lifeguard Qualifications for the 
environment. If lifeguarding is provided from the facility, AD.46 must be met. Appropriately 
trained personnel must also evaluate possible hazards in bodies of water and limit access and 
activities as necessary. Hazards include waves, rip tides, rapids, currents, animals common to 
the area, and winds. When appropriate, campers should be trained to identify hazardous 
conditions and implement needed actions. 
“Camper access” may include methods such as education and scheduling. For example, at a 
public beach the camp may want to designate specific times allowing camp participants to be in 
the water. 
“Facility and equipment” includes docks, ladders, secured rafts, diving boards, watercraft, and 
PFDs. Camp staff members should consider limiting activities if equipment is in obvious 
disrepair. 
In Part E, “rescue equipment” should include items such as backboards, rescue tubes, reaching 
devices, or designated rescue crafts as appropriate to the activity and environment.

PA.10.1 - For camp staff use of swimming facilities, does the camp require that certified 
lifeguards are present at all times? Lifeguards must be positioned in locations where 
they are able to provide effective surveillance, and in close enough proximity to 
participants to readily respond and execute rescue in case of an incident or emergency.
Contextual Education 
Camp policy may disallow staff use during times when regular activities and guards are not 
scheduled. Factors such as age, type of facility, size of group, time of day, and regular aquatic 
schedules should be considered. 
The standard is not intended to regulate use of aquatic facilities by year-round resident site staff 
and their families who swim at times not connected to camp programming.

personnel for 
watercraft activities.
PA.11.1 - For all-adult groups (to include staff at least 18 years of age), does the camp 
require all participants to wear a PFD, follow safety regulations, and: 
A. Be supervised by certified personnel as specified in standard ST.15, or 
B. Be instructed to implement a designated checkout system?
Contextual Education 
The standard requires that the procedures in either Part A or B are followed. 
The standard is not intended to regulate use of watercraft by year-round resident site staff and 
their families whose use occurs at times when there is no camp programming. “All-adult group” 
means every member of the group participating in the activity is at least eighteen (18) years of 
age. 
The purpose of the checkout system is to assure that a responsible staff person is aware that 
staff members on time-off or adult members of a group are using watercraft, and the designated 
staff member checks to see that all participants are accounted for after the activity. The 
checkout system may identify the participants, the equipment in use, the approximate area of 
use, and the time of return.

PA.12 - PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE (PFDS)
Applies to: 
•Day camps
•Resident 
camps
•Short-term 
camps
•Camps serving 
rental groups
MANDATORY 
DNA: PA.12.1 does 
not apply if watercraft 
activities are never 
provided by the camp 
or a vendor. 
PA.12.1 - Does the camp require that personal flotation devices (PFDs) safe for use are 
worn by all individuals in watercraft activities offered through any program or by a 
vendor?
Contextual Education 
This standard: 
•Applies to all watercraft activities. 
•Applies to camp staff members driving boats of any kind up to twenty-six (26) feet in 
length. 
•Does not apply to staff actively lifeguarding from a watercraft. Staff guarding from 
watercraft must have immediate access to a PFD. 
PFDs should be worn by all campers and staff members in all types of small craft including 
canoes, kayaks, rowboats, sail boats, sailboards, ski boats, and while waterskiing. PFDs must 
be appropriate for the type of water and the activity. 
"Safe for use” means that PFDs are: 
•Coast Guard approved; 
•Of proper type, size, and fit for each user; 
•Sufficiently buoyant to support designated weight; and 
•In serviceable condition (clasps, zippers, and other devices are in working condition). 
PFDs must be worn on all watercraft under twenty-six (26) feet in length. Local regulations may 
also mandate use of PFDs for certain types of watercraft or certain ages. If rental groups 
provide their own aquatics personnel, they must be advised of camp policies on the use of 
PFDs. 
Exception—Because PFDs interfere with the correct technique of crew-shell rowing, competitive 
crew shells are exempt from this standard if these conditions are met: a motorized safety craft 
carrying enough PFDs for all participants is within close proximity to the shell at all times; and if 
a non-swimmer is aboard a crew shell, he or she must wear a PFD.

PA.13.1 - Is motorized personal watercraft use by anyone under the age of sixteen (16) 
prohibited whether the program is offered by the camp or by a vendor?
Contextual Education 
The use of motorized personal watercraft in camps other than for rescue operations should be 
evaluated, taking into account safety, environmental concerns, local regulations that may restrict 
their use, and recommendations of manufacturers and watercraft law administrators. 
Camps that choose to use personal watercraft for programming should be familiar with safety 
studies and follow recommendations of manufacturers and safety groups such as the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Rental groups must be advised of a camp’s policies on 
motorized personal watercraft use.

A. Boarding and debarking, trimming, and movement in the craft; 
B. Use of PFDs; and 
C. Self-rescue should the watercraft capsize or flood?
Contextual Education 
This standard applies to the use of all watercraft including sailboats, kayaks, rowboats, canoes, 
sailboards, stand-up paddle boards (SUPs), and rafts as well as motorized boats used by camp 
staff members, campers, and other participants. Training may be provided by qualified camp 
staff representatives, vendors, or rental group leaders. 
Training in the use of PFDs may include floating in PFDs to test fit and acquaint participants 
with buoyancy supplied, if participants’ physical condition and/or water conditions permit. 
Training in self-rescue may include an actual wet exit from appropriate craft, where conditions 
permit.

not apply if watercraft 
instruction, including 
for canoeing, 
kayaking, sailing, 
stand-up paddle 
board (SUP), or 
rowing activities, are 
not offered.
DNA: PA.15.2 does 
not apply if other

conducted.
DNA: PA.15.1 and 
PA.15.2 do not apply 
if camp only uses 
vendor-provided 
personnel for 
watercraft activities.
PA.15.1 - Does the camp provide—or is the rental group advised in writing to provide—a 
staff member to conduct watercraft instruction with these qualifications: 
Instructor rating in the appropriate craft (e.g., canoeing, sailing, rowing) from a 
recognized certifying body OR documentation of experience indicating knowledge and 
skills in teaching and supervision specific to the watercraft activities conducted?
PA.15.2 - Does the camp provide—or is the rental group advised in writing to provide—a 
staff member to conduct watercraft instruction with these qualifications: 
Instructor rating in the activity from a nationally recognized certifying body in the aquatic 
activity (e.g., waterskiing) OR documented experience indicating specific knowledge and 
skills in teaching the activity?
Contextual Education 
The intent of this standard is to provide appropriate instructor-level supervision for boating 
lessons. If this individual is not also qualified to “guard” the activity, camps will need a second 
individual to maintain compliance with the mandatory standard ST.15. The level of skill and 
experience required of the instructor will vary with the aquatic area and type of activity. 
Supervising rowing on a shallow pond does not require the same level of expertise as 
instructing waterskiing on a large lake.

Such a statement could mention expectations for respectful communications with and regarding all individuals, and might go on to specifically indicate individuals of varying abilities, cultures, genders, races, religions, and so on. The statement might speak to what the camp teaches, how campers and staff are expected to interact, the example staff sets for campers, and the examples that all camp participants set as they return to their own worlds.

Camp administrators need to evaluate risk exposure in three major areas: 1. Human Liabilities •Standard of care liabilities (tort or third-party liabilities)—injury to persons caused by negligence, such as injuries related to health services, maintenance, vehicle operation, attractive nuisances, staff selection, staff and camper supervision, inappropriate actions by staff or campers, and other hazards related to the conduct of people; •Loss of human resources (participants, staff, and/or volunteers)— ramification of loss of a human resource on the operation, such as loss of public credibility; loss of income; loss of campers or staff due to stress, injury, illness, death, or other impairment; 2. Financial/Operational Liabilities •Contract liabilities—includes, as examples, lease or rental contracts, contracts for service, program activity contracts, employment agreements, insurance, and other policies that may bind the camp; and 3. Property Resources •Property, buildings, and equipment loss—loss due to fire, collapse, or other damage from natural disasters; breakdown of machinery or equipment; and other hazards related to facilities, property development, or the operation of equipment on the site and so forth. Risk management materials should analyze risk exposure in all areas and specify techniques currently being implemented to reduce, control, or prevent identified risks. In AD.13.2, “risk control techniques” include identifying what methods are being used to control risks and what specific techniques or steps are being taken as part of that method. Camps may follow the outline and process provided in the Risk Exposure Chart on the ACA website, or may want to develop their own risk exposure chart or outline.

First, to document circumstances, witnesses, and actions in serious situations that result in, or nearly result in, injury or danger to individuals. The camp director has the responsibility to determine the level of severity or seriousness of incidents that must be reported. Examples of “incidents” and “accidents” include fires; natural disasters; danger from intruders or trespassers; crises arising out of camper, staff, or rental group behavior (e.g., fighting, serious emotional outbursts, threatening others); or other situations posing serious safety threats. Examples of “near misses” and “emergencies not resulting in injury” may include lost campers, near drownings, or the use of drugs or alcohol by staff or participants. The second intent of this standard is to verify that the camp has a system in place to regularly review all facets of the camp program and property to revise or develop appropriate policies, protocols, and risk management materials, as identified. The camp may use a safety committee, camp services committee, or other group with a representative mix of expertise in the camp’s programs and clientele to analyze the operation or the camp may consult with other outside advisors such as consultants, parents, healthcare personnel, insurance personnel, or other camp administrators.

Concerns for rental groups are addressed in standard AD.43 but may also be included here.  The “review” should include the camp’s administrative staff and the camp's healthcare administrator and staff.A healthcare professional’s “scope of practice” is typically defined by law/license and defines the procedures, actions, and processes permitted for that licensed individual.  The individual’s scope of practice is limited to that which the law allows for specific education and experience, and defined demonstrated competency.“Scope and limits” refers to the specific healthcare services provided to individuals and groups served by the camp, such as summer youth camps and trips.  The policies should define what is and what is not provided in terms of services and personnel (including personnel qualifications).  Camps also need to evaluate where (on and off site) they may need first-aid or health certified personnel, based on characteristics of participants, location of the activity, and type of activity.The “authority and responsibility of the healthcare administrator and provider” should define whether these two functions are held by the same person.  Camps with separate administrative and provider functions should define the responsibilities for each position.  Job description(s) may be used to meet this requirement.Written materials should identify names, locations, and phone numbers of additional health resources.  When campers from a nonmedical religious tradition are part of the population, the camp’s materials should include appropriate contacts for health problems of nonmedical religious campers.Mental health resources may include crisis team support, providing an opportunity for emotional support, and debriefing as needed following critical incidents.  This may also include psychologists, psychiatrists, clergy, and hotline numbers.“Treatment procedures” include those that are commonly accepted and appropriate to the 100 of 208healthcare provider’s credentials when providing care for illnesses or injuries.  This may also include general first-aid guidelines and identify situations when professional medical treatment or advice should be sought.  Camps with both licensed health center staff and non-licensed (tripping) staff should consider two separate treatment procedures, each reflecting the scope of the staff member’s credential (e.g., first-aid certified vs. nurse licensed).Procedures for care and treatment should be appropriate for the scope of practice of personnel providing healthcare in the camp (e.g., nurse, EMT, first-aider) and should be specific to reasonably anticipated camp injuries and illnesses.  Because accepted practices and medications change frequently, these procedures and protocols should be reviewed annually to determine acceptability with current practice.

Staff members will need to “self-medicate” should they not share what medication is being stored.  Any knowledge of prescription medication taken by staff must be kept in the strictest of confidence and shared only on a specific need-to-know basis.  Camp staff medication can be locked in a separate area provided specifically for them (such as a locker).  The intent is to have medication secure and unavailable to anyone other than to whom it is prescribed or for whom it is purchased (over the counter).Drugs should be locked in a cabinet or storage box at all times.  In cases where there is full-time licensed healthcare professional/staff and the healthcare facility or first-aid area is in a permanent building, it is acceptable to have the entire building or room where medication is kept locked when not under direct supervision of the healthcare staff.  Drugs requiring refrigeration may be stored in a locked refrigerator or in a locked container within the refrigerator.Medications include all prescription medications, as well as all over-the-counter drugs that are potentially hazardous if misused (e.g., Tylenol, cold tablets).  They can also include herbal remedies.  \"Controlled possession\" means under the immediate and direct supervision or control of the person taking the medication or of a staff member.  \"Specific directions of a licensed prescriber\" include directions on an original prescription bottle, a note on the signed health examination record, or something in writing from a licensed prescriber.The only camps who may choose “does not apply” to the insulin portion of this standard are camps primarily serving campers with diabetes (i.e., more than 50 percent of enrolled campers are diabetic), or where the camp educational philosophy of diabetes management specifies that camper control of insulin is part of the training program.105 of 208Applies to: •Day camps•Resident camps•Short-term campsMANDATORYWritten Documentation RequiredDNA: HW.13.1 does not apply if no drugs are kept in camp or carried on trips.

Accordingly, the camp’s guidelines should provide for observation levels that are appropriate to a staff member’s skills, experience, requests for help, and previous evaluations. The frequency of observations may also vary based on factors such as the complexity of the program and length of the camp season, but an initial observation should occur early in the camp season with any corrective action requested be implemented immediately. For program staff specifically, the intent of this standard includes that supervisors document observations of leaders conducting program activities with participants. Areas to evaluate include the staff enforcing established safety regulations; providing age- and ability-appropriate instruction to participants; and that staff members can identify and manage environmental and other hazards related to an activity. Documentation may include checklists, copies of performance evaluations, or notes taken by supervisors.","ComplianceDemonstration":"Written documentation: •Verification of observation notes or other written system Visitor interviews: •Director/staff description of observation process Visitor observations: •Randomly selected activities© "},{"id":"ST.35","category":"ST","standard":"ST.35 - GENERAL CAMP ACTIVITIES SUPERVISION RATIOS AND STAFF ","categoryDescription":"STStaff and Supervision: Camper Supervision and Ratios","appliesTo":["Applies to: ","Day camps","Resident camps","Short-term camps"],"DoesNotApply":[],"subDescription":{"ST.35.1":"Does the camp require and identify and/or advise rental groups to require and identify:That ratios of staff who are on duty and supervising campers in units or living areas during unstructured time and in general camp activities should meet the following minimums?Camper Age                  Number Staff   Overnight Campers   Day-only Campers  5 years and younger              1                          5                                  6  6–8 years                                 1                          6                                 8  9–14 years                               1                          8                                10  15-18 years                              1                        10                                12 ","ST.35.2":"Does the camp require and identify and/or advise rental groups to require and identify:Exceptions (if any) to the general ratios in ","ST.35.1 for segments of the day when greater or fewer staff are required for supervision?

Examples include singing, nature studies, religious instruction, and crafts. Ratios and qualifications for supervision of specific program activities are covered in the standards dealing with those specific areas. The camp should implement established supervision ratio policies for its own programs and advise leaders of rental groups about appropriate supervision ratios and policies. Appropriate supervision is one key to camper safety and program quality. Camps should evaluate their policies on a regular basis. To meet the appropriate ratios, a combination of camp staff and adult leaders for rental groups is acceptable. Specific to ST.35.1, “staff” includes those individuals with the responsibility, authority, and training to provide direct supervision to camper groups. This may include counselors, general activity leaders, or other staff members who may provide supervision to campers without assistance. Junior counselors may be included in meeting the ratios in ST.35.1 only if they are considered staff and have received training and supervision to verify their ability to handle camper groups independently. “Staff” does not include campers in leadership training or counselors in training programs (often called CITs or LITs), other “counselor support personnel” (see glossary), or staff who have exclusive administrative, office, food service or maintenance duties. In ST.35.2, any exceptions to the general ratios should be in accordance with the type of activity, the area, and characteristics of the participants. Camp policies may specify no exceptions. Exceptions for times such as free time, rest hour, after lights out, early morning, field trips, and overnights must be well-defined and justified; statistics indicate that these are the times when accidents and incidents are most likely to occur in camps. In ST.35.3, camps must consciously determine when at least two (2) staff members are required to be present with camper groups, both for the sake of safety and to prevent situations that may increase the opportunity for child abuse. Examples of relevant activities and situations include overnights, trips, and showers. When the camp serves campers with special physical, medical, cognitive, or behavioral needs who require additional staff support to participate in camp (e.g., physically or mentally disabled, developmentally delayed, emotionally disturbed), the following ratios of staff and counselor-support personnel to campers are suggested: Camper Description                                                             Staff    Campers  Needing constant and individual assistance or supervision     1             1  Needing close but not constant assistance or supervision       1             2  Needing occasional assistance                                                1             4  Needing minimal assistance                                                     1            5  Age ratios apply to programs staffed by the camp as well as to the instructions given to rental groups for supervision of youth.","ComplianceDemonstration":"Written documentation: •Supervision policies and ratios for campers and rental groups Visitor interviews: •Director/staff description of supervision practices Visitor observations:•Randomly selected camper groups and activities © "},{"id":"ST.36","category":"ST","standard":"ST.36 - TRAINING ON 1:1 CAMPER-TO-STAFF INTERACTIONS","categoryDescription":"STStaff and Supervision: Camper Supervision and Ratios","appliesTo":["Day camps ","Resident camps ","Short-term camps "],"DoesNotApply":[],"subDescription":{"ST.36.1":"Does the camp: Provide training based on their policy to all staff members to minimize the potential of any staff member being in a one-on-one camper–staff situation when out of sight of others?AND/OR","ST.36.2":"Does the camp: Advise rental groups to provide training to all staff members to minimize the potential of any rental group staffer being in a one-on-one camper–personnel situation when out of sight of others?"},"ContextualEducation":"Appropriate supervision and interaction between campers and staff (to include counselors, support staff, and administrative staff) are key to camper–staff safety.

Similarly, if the camp offers horseback riding, equipment may include saddles, bridles, girths, ropes-related equipment. This standard applies to equipment provided by the camp and/or participants (such as backpacks on trips). Camp staff should follow specific guidelines from authoritative sources on what to look for in conducting safety checks prior to each use. “Elements” in PD.2.5 are relevant in the context of adventure/challenge activities and refer to stations or events in ropes courses and challenge courses, to climbing walls, rappelling towers, zip lines, Tarzan swings, and related elements. In the context of horseback riding, equipment (including saddles, bridles, girths, and ropes) should be checked carefully for excessive wear or deterioration. The equipment check should assure an adequate supply of appropriately sized equipment for participants.Authoritative source guidelines should also be followed regarding documentation needed for inspections, use, maintenance, and replacement. Maintenance records for equipment include hours of use and falls on climbing and belay ropes; inspection records for harnesses, carabiners, helmets, and webbing; and purchase, cleaning, and replacement dates for equipment.

Rules, boundaries, schedules, responsibilities, and communication should be reviewed with all individuals prior to participation. (cont.) Trained staff members may be from the camp or from the public facility or contracted service. If camp staff personnel are lifeguarding, they must meet ST.12, Lifeguard Qualifications for the environment. If lifeguarding is provided from the facility, AD.46 must be met. Appropriately trained personnel must also evaluate possible hazards in bodies of water and limit access and activities as necessary. Hazards include waves, rip tides, rapids, currents, animals common to the area, and winds. When appropriate, campers should be trained to identify hazardous conditions and implement needed actions. “Camper access” may include methods such as education and scheduling. For example, at a public beach the camp may want to designate specific times allowing camp participants to be in the water. “Facility and equipment” includes docks, ladders, secured rafts, diving boards, watercraft, and PFDs. Camp staff members should consider limiting activities if equipment is in obvious disrepair. In Part E, “rescue equipment” should include items such as backboards, rescue tubes, reaching devices, or designated rescue crafts as appropriate to the activity and environment.

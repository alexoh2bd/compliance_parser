I completed this project at Roughing It Day Camp to deconstruct the American Camp Association 
compliance forms which the camp abides by. Using parser.js, I used express to address a local 
HTTP POST request at localhost:3000 in order to parse the pdf into text, saving the text under 
test.txt. I then used the textparse.js to convert the raw text file to a json format according 
to the camp's needs and purposes. The resulting json can be seen on the same page as the pdf parser
by pressing the "Parse Text to Json" button on. I then used the result in jsontest.json to 
create a database for the camp to keep track of their compliance requirements.
